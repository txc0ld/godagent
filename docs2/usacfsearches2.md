2. **ROI**: Benefit / Cost ratio
3. **Certainty**: Confidence in success
4. **Strategic Value**: Long-term competitive advantage
5. **Quick Wins**: Number of fast, high-value deliverables

```bash
# Start with breadth, then increase depth

# Iteration 1: Quick scan (Depth 1)
DEPTH=1 BREADTH=20 ./search.sh
# Result: High-level overview, many areas, low confidence

# Iteration 2: Standard analysis (Depth 3)
DEPTH=3 BREADTH=10 ./search.sh --focus "areas_with_high_uncertainty"
# Result: Deeper analysis of key areas, medium confidence

# Iteration 3: Deep dive (Depth 5)
DEPTH=5 BREADTH=5 ./search.sh --focus "critical_gaps_and_risks"
# Result: Exhaustive analysis of critical areas, high confidence

# Adaptive depth based on uncertainty:
# IF confidence < 70% in area X: Increase depth for X
```

## SECTION 10: TROUBLESHOOTING & ERROR HANDLING

### 10.1: Common Issues & Solutions

```bash
### Issue: Agent produced low confidence results (<70%)

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
npx claude-flow memory retrieve --key "search/{phase}/confidence/{agent_id}"
```

**Solution:**
1. Identify specific low-confidence areas

3. If iterate: Address specific gaps and re-run phase
4. If pivot: Adjust strategy and proceed differently

### Issue: Adversarial review found critical flaw

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
npx claude-flow memory retrieve --key "search/adversarial/critiques/{critique_id}"
```

3. Apply corrections
4. Re-run affected phases
5. Re-validate

### Issue: Stakeholder perspectives conflict

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
npx claude-flow memory retrieve --key "search/perspectives/conflicts/{conflict_id}"
```

**Solution:**
1. Analyze root cause of conflict
2. Facilitate stakeholder discussion (if possible)
3. Apply conflict resolution strategy
4. Document trade-offs
5. Proceed with consensus OR escalate decision

### Issue: Web searches not returning relevant results

**Solution:**
1. Refine search queries (more specific)
2. Try alternative phrasings
3. Search for related concepts
4. Document limitation and proceed with partial info
5. Flag for manual research if critical
```

### 10.2: Graceful Degradation Strategies

```bash
# If analysis quality drops below threshold:

IF overall_confidence < 0.70:
  THEN:
    - Flag low-confidence areas
    - Generate specific research plan
    - Offer partial analysis with caveats
    - Recommend manual expert review
    - Provide confidence-weighted recommendations
    
# If resource limits exceeded:

IF time_limit_approaching OR token_budget_low:
  THEN:
    - Prioritize critical areas
    - Reduce breadth, maintain depth for priorities
    - Fast-track to minimum viable analysis
    - Document what was skipped
    - Recommend follow-up detailed analysis

# If tools unavailable:

IF web_search_fails OR memory_store_fails:
  THEN:
    - Use degraded mode (internal knowledge only)
    - Clearly mark all claims as "unverified"
    - Reduce confidence scores by 20%
    - Flag need for validation with tools
```
