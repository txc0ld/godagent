## OBJECTIVE
OK Implement everything.
YOU MUST FOLLOW /home/unixdude/projects/project1/docs2/claudeflow.md. AND USE SUBAGENTS VIA CLAUDE FLOW
Any agent can pick up tasks following the dependency order in  /home/unixdude/projects/project1/docs/god-agent-specs/intelligent-desc/TASKS-IDESC-001.md
Make sure to follow /home/unixdude/projects/project1/docs2/claudeflow.md AND USE SUBAGENTS VIA CLAUDE FLOW
FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS BELOW. Must ADHERE TO /home/unixdude/projects/project1/docs/god-agent-specs/intelligent-desc/CONSTITUTION-IDESC-001.md

## REQUIRED READING (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY ACTION)
  |---------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | PRD-IDESC-001.md          | 24KB | 18 REQ-IDs, 12 NFR-IDs, 6 user stories, 12 edge cases, 7 guardrails             |
  | SPEC-IDESC-001.md         | 51KB | 8 functional specs, 5 interfaces, 3 data flows, 2 state machines, 45 test cases |
  | TECH-IDESC-001.md         | 45KB | 4 components, 3 DB tables, 3 API endpoints, performance budgets                 |
  | TASKS-IDESC-001.md        | 81KB | 46 tasks across 11 sprints (~19 dev days)                                       |
  | CONSTITUTION-IDESC-001.md | 21KB | 64 rules, 10 articles, 5 security requirements                                  |

After reading all docs, select optimal reasoning mode(s). Ultra think.

## DELIVERABLES
1. Use Claudeflow to track task completions in /home/unixdude/projects/project1/docs/god-agent-specs/phd-token-limits/_ai` - tracks task + PRD changes (only if PRD changes) and completion state
2. Update  the following In PRD folder when tasks are completed (/home/unixdude/projects/project1/docs/god-agent-specs/phd-token-limits/_ai):
  - activeContext.md - Current focus, priorities, decisions
  - implementation-state.json - Task status tracking
  - progress.md - Progress log
3. Implement all tasks per `/home/unixdude/projects/project1/docs/god-agent-specs/intelligent-desc/TASKS-IDESC-001.md `
4. Review implementations to confirm adherence to requirements and constitution. 

## AGENT COORDINATION (per /home/unixdude/projects/project1/docs2/claudeflow.md)
- Select correct agent types + models for each task
- Run subagents **SYNCHRONOUSLY** - respect dependency order
- **Verify all subagent work personally** - never trust without validation
- Each subagent MUST report: what memories created + where stored
- Brief next subagent on exactly which memories to access
- Shared memories enable N agents to operate as one unit

## SUBAGENT MODEL SELECTION
| Task Type | Model | Flag |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Complex Reasoning/Debugging | Opus 4.5 | `--model claude-opus-4-5-20251101` |
| Code Review | Opus 4.5 | `--model claude-opus-4-5-20251101` |
| Code Implementation | Sonnet 4.5 | `--model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` |
| Testing/Linting | Sonnet 4.5 | `--model claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` |
| Index Updates | Haiku 4.5 | `--model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |
| File Operations | Haiku 4.5 | `--model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` |

## ENGINEERING STANDARDS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **No backwards compatibility** - break cleanly or work correctly
- **No workarounds/fallbacks** - fail fast, fix root cause
- **No mock test data** - real data only, verify actual behavior
- **No false-passing tests** - tests must reflect true system state
- Run linters on all code

## ERROR HANDLING
All failures must immediately halt and log: what failed + full diagnostic context + enough info to fix.

## PRE-PUSH GATE (`/pushrepo`)
Before any push, verify **ALL** requirements in '/home/unixdude/projects/project1/docs/god-agent-specs/intelligent-desc/CONSTITUTION-IDESC-001.md'.
If ANY requirement unmet → **STOP** → Alert me with:
- Which requirement failed
- Current state vs expected state
- Suggested fix

## CODEBASE ALIGNMENT
1. Audit task against current codebase structure
2. **Review git history** for recent changes
3. Verify all file paths/names exist as referenced
4. Update any stale references in task docs'
## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
All docs must enable a zero-context AI agent to implement perfectly with no ambiguity.
Prompt subagents to: understand problem → select optimal reasoning → execute.
