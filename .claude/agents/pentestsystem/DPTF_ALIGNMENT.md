# DPTF Alignment Reference

## Dynamic Penetration Testing Framework Integration

All assessment agents in this directory align with the **Dynamic Penetration Testing Framework (DPTF)** outlined in `DYNAMIC_PENETRATION_TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md`.

### Core DPTF Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed gradually through structured phases
2. **Risk-Based Approach**: Prioritization based on business impact and exploitability
3. **Continuous Validation**: Ongoing verification throughout engagement lifecycle
4. **Stakeholder Communication**: Clear reporting at every phase
5. **Compliance Integration**: Regulatory requirement mapping from discovery to remediation

### Phase Alignment Matrix

| Agent | Phase | DPTF Stage | Deliverable |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `vulnerability-landscape-mapper.md` | 0.3 | Reconnaissance | Vulnerability inventory |
| `remediation-prioritizer.md` | 3.2 | Risk Assessment | Remediation roadmap |
| `compensating-controls-analyst.md` | 3.3 | Risk Assessment | Temporary controls |
| `remediation-tracking-coordinator.md` | 4.3 | Reporting | Tracking matrix |
| `continuous-testing-strategist.md` | 5.2 | Verification | Testing program |

### DPTF Methodology Integration

All agents implement:
- **Hooks**: Pre/post-task coordination via Claude Flow
- **Memory**: Persistent state across swarm agents
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Type-safe data structures
- **YAML Workflows**: Structured methodology definitions
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation checklists and review gates

### Agent Coordination Protocol

```yaml
coordination:
  framework: DPTF
  swarm_topology:
    - reconnaissance: mesh
    - exploitation: hierarchical
    - assessment: star
    - reporting: mesh
    - verification: ring

  memory_schema:
    pentest:
      phase0: reconnaissance_data
      phase1: enumeration_results
      phase2: exploitation_evidence
      phase3: risk_assessments
      phase4: reports_tracking
      phase5: verification_results
      phase6: compliance_mappings
```

### Success Criteria Alignment

Each agent adheres to DPTF success criteria:
- ✅ Complete deliverable generation
- ✅ Cross-phase coordination via memory
- ✅ Stakeholder communication protocols
- ✅ Quality assurance validation
- ✅ Documentation standards compliance
