```markdown
# Arc A: Problem-First Perspective - Key Research Questions

**Status**: Not Started
**Last Updated**: [Date]
**Primary Contributor**: problem-validator

## Research Focus
What problems exist that keep the target market awake at night?

## Core Questions (Must Answer)

### Burning Problem Identification
1. What specific problem keeps the target market up at night?
2. Can customers clearly articulate this problem without prompting?
3. Are customers currently using makeshift solutions or suffering through it?
4. What is the quantifiable economic impact of this problem going unsolved?
5. How urgent is solving this problem (must-have vs. nice-to-have)?

### Willingness to Pay Validation
6. What evidence exists of customer willingness to pay for solutions?
7. Have customers invested time/money in current workarounds?
8. What price sensitivity exists in the target market?

### Current Solution Analysis
9. What existing solutions attempt to address this problem?
10. Why are current solutions inadequate?
11. Are current solutions creating their own problems (disruption opportunity)?

### Market Validation
12. How widespread is this problem across the target segment?
13. What segments experience this problem most acutely?

## Supporting Questions (Context)

1. What triggers this problem?
2. How frequently does it occur?
3. What is the typical duration of pain?
4. What happens if the problem is not solved?
5. Is the problem getting worse or better over time?

- [ ] Burning problem test applied (5 criteria scored)
- [ ] Critical knowledge gaps identified and addressed
- [ ] Patterns and contradictions documented
- [ ] Adaptive reflection completed
- [ ] Overall burning problem score calculated (>7.5 to proceed)

## Evidence Quality Standards

- **Source Tiers**: >70% from Tier 1/2 (authoritative/credible)
- **Recency**: >80% from last 2 years
- **Citation Format**: All findings must include [Source, Date, URL]
```

### Phase 3: File Length Management

```yaml
file_management_rules:
  max_lines_per_file: 500  # Split before hitting limit

  splitting_strategy:
    primary_findings:
      part1: "Lines 1-450"
      part2: "Lines 451-900"
      part3: "Lines 901-1350"
      cross_reference: "Add link at bottom: 'Continued in primary_findings_part2.md'"

    monitoring:
      check_frequency: "After each major addition"
      command: "wc -l filename.md"
      action_threshold: "At 450 lines, create next part"

  file_naming:
    pattern: "[document_name]_part[N].md"
    examples:
      - "primary_findings_part1.md"
      - "primary_findings_part2.md"
      - "competitive_analysis_part1.md"
```

### Phase 4: Citation Format Standards

```markdown
## Citation Format

**Standard Format**:
[Finding description] ([Source Name], [Date], [URL])

**Examples**:

**Good**:
- "78% of project managers use manual spreadsheets for prioritization" (G2 Project Management Reviews, Jan 2024, https://g2.com/categories/project-management)
- "Average team loses 12 hours/week to manual task tracking" (Reddit r/projectmanagement Discussion, Dec 15 2023, https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/abc123)

**Bad**:
- "Most users struggle with prioritization" (no source)
- "Research shows problem exists" (vague source)
- "G2 reviews" (no date, no URL, no specific finding)

## Source Tier Classification

Always classify sources in documentation:

**Tier 1** (Authoritative):
- Peer-reviewed academic papers
- Major analyst firms (Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey)
- Government/regulatory reports

**Tier 2** (Credible):
- Reputable tech publications
- Customer review platforms (G2, Capterra, Trustpilot)
- Industry associations

**Tier 3** (Anecdotal - needs corroboration):
- Reddit/Quora discussions
- Individual blog posts
- Social media comments
```

### Phase 5: Progress Tracking

```markdown
## Document Header Format

Every research document should include:

**Status**: [Not Started | In Progress | First Draft | Under Review | Complete]
**Last Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Primary Contributor**: [agent-name or role]
**Word Count**: [~X words]
**Citation Count**: [X sources]
```

### Phase 6: Markdown Formatting Standards

```yaml
formatting_rules:
  headings:
    h1: "# Document Title (once per file)"
    h2: "## Major Sections"
    h3: "### Subsections"
    h4: "#### Details (use sparingly)"

  lists:
    unordered: "- Bullet points for findings"
    ordered: "1. Numbered for sequential steps"
    checkboxes: "- [ ] For validation criteria"

  code_blocks:
    yaml: "```yaml for structured data"
    typescript: "```typescript for interfaces"
    markdown: "```markdown for examples"
    bash: "```bash for commands"

  emphasis:
    bold: "**Important terms**"
    italic: "*Emphasis or foreign terms*"
    code: "`inline code or technical terms`"

  tables:
    format: "Use for comparisons and data"
    example: |
      | Column 1 | Column 2 |
      |----------|----------|
      | Data     | Data     |

  links:
    format: "[Link Text](URL)"
    internal: "[See Arc B Analysis](arc_B_patterns.md)"
    external: "[G2 Reviews](https://g2.com/...)"
```

## File Organization Best Practices

```yaml
directory_structure:
  principle: "Hierarchical by research phase"

  naming_conventions:
    use_underscores: true  # arc_A_problem NOT arc-A-problem
    descriptive_names: true  # burning_problem_analysis NOT analysis1
    sequential_prefixes: true  # 00_, 01_, 02_ for ordering

  file_types:
    research: "*.md files in docs/research/"
    never_in_root: true  # NEVER save to project root

  organization_by_phase:
    phase_0: "Business input (user-provided)"
    phase_1: "Strategy and planning"
    phase_2: "Data collection (per arc)"
    phase_3: "Analysis (patterns, gaps, decisions)"
    phase_4: "Synthesis (integrated insights)"
    phase_5: "Final deliverables (positioning, recommendations)"
```

## MCP Tool Integration

### Memory Coordination

```javascript
// Report documentation status
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage {
  action: "store",
  key: "swarm/documentation/status",
  namespace: "coordination",
  value: JSON.stringify({
    agent: "documentation-specialist",
    status: "organizing",
    directories_created: 15,
    files_created: 28,
    templates_populated: 10,
    total_citations: 0,  // Updated as research progresses
    timestamp: Date.now()
  })
}

// Track file structure
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage {
  action: "store",
  key: "swarm/shared/file-structure",
  namespace: "coordination",
  value: JSON.stringify({
    base_path: "docs/research/",
    phases: ["00_business_input", "01_initial_strategy", "02_data_collection", "03_analysis", "04_synthesis", "05_final_positioning"],
    total_files: 28,
    completion_status: {
      phase_0: "complete",
      phase_1: "in_progress",
      phase_2: "not_started"
    }
  })
}
```
