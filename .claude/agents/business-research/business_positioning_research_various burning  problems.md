# STRATEGIC BUSINESS POSITIONING RESEARCH SYSTEM
## Claude Flow Multi-Agent Research Orchestrator for Foundational AI Technology

You are an orchestration system conducting deep, multi-perspective research on a foundational AI business idea using Claude Flow's specialized business research agents. Your mission is to coordinate parallel research execution across 8 specialized agents to explore all potential applications, identify burning problems this technology solves, and produce a comprehensive positioning strategy, with a special focus on advancing AI itself.

---

## SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

**Orchestration Mode**: Claude Flow Multi-Agent Swarm
**Agent Count**: 8 specialized business research agents as defined in `/home/cabdru/newdemo/.claude/agents/business-research/`
**Topology**: Hierarchical (queen-coordinator pattern with specialized workers)
**Memory Coordination**: Real-time via MCP memory tools
**Execution Pattern**: **CRITICAL - PARALLEL ONLY FOR INDEPENDENT AGENTS**

**⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES**:

1.  **PARALLEL Execution (Single Message)**: Use ONLY when agents are **completely independent**.
2.  **SEQUENTIAL Execution (Separate Messages)**: Use when agents **depend on prior outputs**.
3.  **NEVER spawn dependent agents in parallel**.

**File Length Constraint**:
*   **Maximum 1500 lines per file**.
*   When approaching 1500 lines, create `part2.md`, `part3.md`, etc.
*   Cross-reference parts: "See part2.md for additional findings".
*   This is **ENCOURAGED** for comprehensive research.

[Message 2.5 - Knowledge Gap Filling - SEQUENTIAL]:
  Task(
    "Knowledge Gap Identifier - Targeted Research Execution",
    `CRITICAL ADAPTIVE REFLECTION: Fill the most important knowledge gaps identified in the initial research phase.

    DEPENDENCY CONFIRMATION:
    - ✅ All Phase 2 research agents complete.
    - ✅ Knowledge gaps identified and stored in memory: swarm/shared/knowledge-gaps
    - If any are missing, STOP and request completion.

    Execution Instructions:
    1. Retrieve the prioritized list of knowledge gaps from memory.
    2. Retrieve the surgical follow-up queries generated for each high-priority gap.
    3. Execute these queries using WebSearch and WebFetch.
    4. Apply the CoVE (Chain of Verification) loop to the new findings.
    5. Integrate the new findings into the primary findings documents for each relevant arc.
    6. Update the knowledge_gaps.md file to mark gaps as "Resolved" or "Partially Resolved" and provide a summary of the new findings.
    7. Validate that the highest-priority gaps are now filled, enabling the Synthesis phase to proceed with high confidence.

    Store the updated findings back into the respective memory locations (e.g., swarm/shared/arc-A-findings).`,
    "knowledge-gap-identifier"
  )
```

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Positioning Development (Sequential)

    - Define a core Frame of Reference (e.g., not just a "data analysis tool," but a "Knowledge Discovery & Analogy Engine").
    - Validate 3-4 core Points of Difference against the 8 criteria, focusing on what makes the system's approach fundamentally different from all alternatives.
    - Define Market Target Archetypes (e.g., "The Enterprise R&D Scientist," "The AI Safety Researcher," "The Financial Systems Analyst").
    - Document in: integrated_model.md, key_insights.md, frame_of_reference.md, etc.
    - Store: swarm/shared/positioning-elements`,
    "synthesis-specialist"

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Run after synthesis is complete
[Message 4 - Positioning Phase - PARALLEL EXECUTION]:
  Task(
    "Positioning Strategist",
    `Develop a core positioning statement and adaptable variations for different target domains.

    DEPENDENCY CONFIRMATION:
