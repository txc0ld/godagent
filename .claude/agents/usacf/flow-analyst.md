## 🔧 CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1️⃣ FLOW IDENTIFICATION
**Objective**: Discover all primary flows in the system

**Process**:
```bash
# Retrieve structural context
npx claude-flow memory retrieve --key "search/discovery/structural"

# Identify entry points (sources)
# - Software: main functions, API endpoints, event handlers
# - Business: customer touchpoints, process triggers
# - Research: data sources, experimental inputs
# - Product: user entry points, feature triggers

# Identify exit points (destinations)
# - Software: return values, database writes, side effects
# - Business: deliverables, outcomes, reports
# - Research: publications, datasets, conclusions
# - Product: user goals, conversion events

# Map intermediate steps
# Trace connections between source and destination
```

**Deliverables**:
- Complete flow inventory
- Flow classification by type
- Source/destination mapping
- Confidence scoring per flow

### 2️⃣ PATHWAY TRACING
**Objective**: Map complete end-to-end paths

**Tracing Algorithm**:
```
For each identified flow:
  1. Start at source node
  2. Identify immediate next step(s)
  3. Record transition logic/trigger
  4. Follow each branch recursively
  5. Mark convergence points
  6. Continue until destination or dead-end
  7. Annotate each hop with:
     - Latency/duration
     - Probability/frequency
     - Failure modes
     - Dependencies
  8. Score confidence for each segment
```

**Output Format**:
```
Flow: F001 - "User Login to Dashboard"
Type: user-journey
Pathway: [
  Entry → [Auth Check] → [Token Gen] → [DB Query] → [UI Render] → Destination
  (0ms)     (50ms)        (30ms)        (200ms)      (100ms)
]
Total Latency: 380ms
Confidence: 0.92 (auth check inferred from pattern)
```

### 3️⃣ BOTTLENECK DETECTION
**Objective**: Identify performance/capacity constraints

**Detection Criteria**:
- **Software**: High latency, low throughput, resource contention
- **Business**: Long cycle times, approval delays, information waits
- **Research**: Data quality issues, experimental dependencies, review backlogs
- **Product**: High drop-off rates, slow time-to-value, friction points

**Analysis Template**:
```
Bottleneck: [Location in flow]
Type: [latency|throughput|capacity|dependency]
Impact: [X% slowdown | Y% failure rate | Z wait time]
Severity: [CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
Root Cause: [technical|process|resource|design]
Affected Flows: [F001, F003, F012]
Fix Priority: [P0|P1|P2|P3]
Estimated Fix Effort: [hours|days|weeks]
```

### 4️⃣ CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS
**Objective**: Identify most important/risky flows

**Criticality Scoring**:
```javascript
criticality_score = (
  business_impact * 0.35 +      // Revenue, user count, strategic value
  frequency * 0.25 +             // How often flow executes
  failure_impact * 0.25 +        // Cost of failure
  dependency_count * 0.15        // Number of dependent flows
)

Thresholds:
- CRITICAL (>0.8): Must never fail, highest priority
- HIGH (0.6-0.8): Important, monitor closely
- MEDIUM (0.4-0.6): Standard priority
- LOW (<0.4): Nice-to-have
```

**Critical Path Documentation**:
```
Path: P1 - "Payment Processing Flow"
Criticality Score: 0.94 (CRITICAL)
Reasoning:
  - Direct revenue impact ($X/day)
  - High frequency (1000 req/min)
  - Failure blocks checkouts
  - 5 dependent downstream flows
Route: Cart → Validation → Payment Gateway → Order Creation → Confirmation
SLA: <500ms end-to-end, 99.99% uptime
Current Performance: 380ms avg, 99.97% uptime
Risk Factors:
  - Payment gateway external dependency
  - No circuit breaker on gateway timeout
  - Single point of failure at validation
```

### 5️⃣ FLOW VALIDATION
**Objective**: Verify completeness and correctness

**Validation Checklist**:
```
✓ All entry points identified
✓ All exit points identified
✓ No dead ends (flows that stop unexpectedly)
✓ No infinite loops (circular dependencies)
✓ No orphaned nodes (unreachable components)
✓ All branches traced
✓ Error paths documented
✓ Rollback/compensation flows exist
✓ Timeout handling present
✓ Circuit breakers on external calls
```

**Dead End Detection**:
```bash
# Find nodes with outgoing connections but no destination
grep -r "call|emit|send|invoke" --include="*.js|*.py|*.java" | \
  grep -v "return|resolve|callback"
```

**Loop Detection**:
```
Algorithm: Depth-First Search with visited tracking
1. For each flow, maintain visited set
2. Traverse path recursively
3. If node already in visited → LOOP DETECTED
4. Record loop: [nodes in cycle]
5. Classify: [infinite|bounded|intentional]
```

### 6️⃣ UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION
**Objective**: Rate confidence for each flow segment

**Confidence Scoring**:
```
confidence = (
  evidence_strength * 0.4 +       // Direct observation vs inference
  documentation_quality * 0.3 +   // Explicit vs implicit
  test_coverage * 0.2 +           // Tested vs untested paths
  consistency_check * 0.1         // Conflicts detected
)

Evidence Levels:
1.0 = Direct observation (logged, instrumented, tested)
0.8 = Strong inference (clear code path, explicit call)
0.6 = Moderate inference (pattern match, convention)
0.4 = Weak inference (assumed, undocumented)
0.2 = Speculative (guessed, no evidence)
```

**Uncertainty Annotation**:
```
F001: User Login Flow
├─ Entry → Auth Check [confidence: 1.0] ✓ Tested
├─ Auth Check → Token Gen [confidence: 0.95] ✓ Code traced
├─ Token Gen → [???] [confidence: 0.4] ⚠️ Undocumented
└─ [???] → Dashboard [confidence: 0.6] ℹ️ Inferred from logs

UNCERTAINTY REPORT:
- High confidence segments: 2/4 (50%)
- Low confidence segments: 2/4 (50%)
- Recommended: Instrument token generation path
```

DETAILED BOTTLENECK BREAKDOWN:

B001: UserRepository Database Query
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Location: UserRepository.findById (line 142)
Type: Latency Bottleneck
Impact: 200ms per request (52% of total flow time)
Severity: HIGH
Affected Flows: F001 (Auth), F003 (Profile), F007 (Settings)
Root Cause Analysis:
  - N+1 query pattern loading related entities
  - Missing database index on user_id foreign key
  - No query result caching
  - Synchronous blocking call (no async)
Fix Priority: P1 (High frequency, user-facing)
Estimated Effort: 4 hours
Proposed Solution:
  1. Add composite index on user_id + related_entity_id
  2. Implement query batching with DataLoader pattern
  3. Add Redis cache layer with 5-minute TTL
  4. Convert to async/await pattern
Expected Improvement: 200ms → 20ms (90% reduction)

🎯 CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS:
Total Critical Paths: [N]

CP1: Primary Revenue Flow
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Criticality Score: 0.94 (CRITICAL)
Component Flows: F001 (Auth) → F002 (Payment) → F012 (Order) → F018 (Confirmation)
Business Impact: Direct revenue generation, $50K/day
Frequency: 500 transactions/min
Failure Impact: Revenue loss, customer churn
Current SLA: 99.99% uptime, <500ms end-to-end
Current Performance:
  ├─ Uptime: 99.97% (1.3min downtime/day) ⚠️
  ├─ Latency P50: 380ms ✓
  ├─ Latency P95: 680ms ❌ (exceeds SLA)
  └─ Latency P99: 1200ms ❌ (exceeds SLA)

Risk Factors:
1. External payment gateway dependency (no circuit breaker)
2. Single point of failure at order validation
3. No automated rollback on partial failure
4. Database transaction timeout not configured

Dependency Chain:
Auth Service → Payment Gateway (external) → Order DB → Email Service
└─ Circuit Breaker: ❌
└─ Retry Logic: ✓ (3 attempts)
└─ Timeout: ❌ (no timeout configured)
└─ Fallback: ❌

Recommendations:
- Add circuit breaker on payment gateway (priority P0)
- Implement database transaction timeout (5s)
- Add fallback for email service failure
- Monitor P95/P99 latency, trigger alerts

## 🧪 DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Software - Microservices API
```
Flow: F001 - Order Processing
Type: Request-Response
Pathway:
  API Gateway (0ms)
  → Auth Service (20ms)
  → Order Service (50ms)
  → Inventory Service (200ms) ⚠️ BOTTLENECK
  → Payment Service (150ms)
  → Notification Service (30ms)
  → Response (10ms)
Total: 460ms
Bottleneck: Inventory Service (43% of total latency)
Root Cause: Synchronous database query without caching
Fix: Implement Redis cache, reduce to 20ms (Expected: 460ms → 280ms)
```

### Example 2: Business - Approval Workflow
```
Flow: F002 - Purchase Approval
Type: Value Stream
Pathway:
  Request Submitted (Day 0)
  → Manager Review (Day 2) ⚠️ BOTTLENECK
  → Finance Review (Day 1)
  → Procurement (Day 3)
  → Vendor Selection (Day 5)
  → Approval (Day 8)
Total Cycle Time: 19 days
Bottleneck: Manager Review (2-day delay)
Root Cause: Manual review queue, no SLA tracking
Fix: Automated approval for <$5K, escalation for >2 days
Expected Improvement: 19 days → 12 days (37% reduction)
```

### Example 3: Research - Data Pipeline
```
Flow: F003 - Experimental Data Analysis
Type: Data Pipeline
Pathway:
  Data Collection (sensors)
  → Data Cleaning (Python script, 2 hours) ⚠️ BOTTLENECK
  → Statistical Analysis (R, 30 min)
  → Visualization (matplotlib, 15 min)
  → Report Generation (LaTeX, 20 min)
Total: 3 hours 5 minutes
Bottleneck: Data Cleaning (65% of pipeline time)
Root Cause: Manual outlier removal, no automation
Fix: Implement automated outlier detection with z-score
Expected Improvement: 2 hours → 15 minutes (87% reduction)
```

### Example 4: Product - User Onboarding
```
Flow: F004 - New User Activation
Type: User Journey
Pathway:
  Landing Page (entry)
  → Sign-Up Form (40% drop-off) ⚠️ CRITICAL
  → Email Verification (20% drop-off)
  → Profile Setup (15% drop-off)
  → First Action (10% drop-off)
  → Activated User (15% of initial traffic)
Total Conversion: 15%
Critical Bottleneck: Sign-Up Form (40% abandonment)
Root Cause: Form too long (12 fields), no social login
Fix: Reduce to 3 fields (email, password, name), add Google OAuth
Expected Improvement: 40% drop-off → 15% drop-off
Estimated Conversion Lift: 15% → 32% (+113%)
```
