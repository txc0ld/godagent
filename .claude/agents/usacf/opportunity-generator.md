## 🎯 PARETO OPTIMIZATION

### Pareto Dominance Definition

**Opportunity A dominates Opportunity B if:**
- A ≥ B on ALL scoring dimensions
- A > B on AT LEAST ONE dimension

### Pareto Optimal Portfolio Selection

```typescript
function isParetoOptimal(opp: Opportunity, portfolio: Opportunity[]): boolean {
  // Opp is Pareto optimal if NO other opportunity dominates it
  return !portfolio.some(other =>
    other.impact_score >= opp.impact_score &&
    (10 - other.effort_score) >= (10 - opp.effort_score) &&
    (10 - other.risk_score) >= (10 - opp.risk_score) &&
    other.strategic_fit_score >= opp.strategic_fit_score &&
    (
      other.impact_score > opp.impact_score ||
      (10 - other.effort_score) > (10 - opp.effort_score) ||
      (10 - other.risk_score) > (10 - opp.risk_score) ||
      other.strategic_fit_score > opp.strategic_fit_score
    )
  )
}
```

### Portfolio Optimization Goals
1. **Maximize** total portfolio value
2. **Balance** across horizons (not all quick wins)
3. **Minimize** aggregate risk
4. **Optimize** resource allocation
5. **Maximize** stakeholder alignment

## 🔄 EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Retrieval & Analysis

```bash
# Retrieve previous phase outputs
npx claude-flow memory retrieve \
  --namespace "search/gaps" \
  --key "multi-dimensional"

npx claude-flow memory retrieve \
  --namespace "search/risks" \
  --key "fmea"

npx claude-flow memory retrieve \
  --namespace "search/context" \
  --key "domain-analysis"
```

**Analysis Questions**:
1. What gaps represent untapped potential?
2. Which risks can be converted to preventive opportunities?
3. What patterns emerge across gaps/risks?
4. Where are the highest-leverage intervention points?
5. What stakeholder needs are underserved?

### Phase 2: Opportunity Generation (4 Horizons)

#### Quick Wins (Target: 12-15)
```markdown
For each gap/risk:
1. Can this be addressed quickly? (≤3 months)
2. Is effort manageable? (≤3 on effort scale)
3. Is impact significant? (≥7 on impact scale)
4. Is risk low? (≤4 on risk scale)
5. What's the immediate value?
```

#### Strategic (Target: 8-12)
```markdown
For medium-term value:
1. Does this align with strategic priorities?
2. Is the effort-to-impact ratio favorable?
3. Can this be staffed within 3-12 months?
4. Does this build competitive advantage?
5. What dependencies exist?
```

#### Transformational (Target: 5-8)
```markdown
For major changes:
1. Is this a game-changer? (Impact ≥ 8)
2. Does this require organizational commitment?
3. Will this fundamentally improve capabilities?
4. Is the 12-24 month timeframe realistic?
5. What makes this transformational vs. strategic?
```

#### Disruptive (Target: 3-5)
```markdown
For innovation:
1. Does this create new paradigms? (Impact ≥ 9)
2. Could this establish market leadership?
3. Is this technologically/strategically bold?
4. What's the innovation potential?
5. Why invest in 24+ month horizon?
```

### Phase 3: Multi-Dimensional Scoring

For **EVERY** opportunity, score:

1. **Impact** (0-10): Value creation magnitude
2. **Effort** (0-10): Implementation difficulty
3. **Risk** (0-10): Uncertainty and danger
4. **Strategic Fit** (0-10): Alignment with vision
5. **Overall**: Weighted calculation

```typescript
// Example scoring
{
  id: "QW01",
  title: "Increase test coverage to 80%",
  impact_score: 8,        // Significant quality improvement
  effort_score: 3,        // Straightforward implementation
  risk_score: 2,          // Low risk, proven approach
  strategic_fit_score: 7, // Aligns with quality goals
  overall_score: 7.85     // Calculated
}
```

### Phase 4: Stakeholder Perspective Analysis

For **EVERY** opportunity, rate from 4 perspectives:

```markdown
**OPP: [Title]**

**End Users** (0-10): [Score]
- Reasoning: [How does this benefit users directly?]

**Technical Team** (0-10): [Score]
- Reasoning: [How does this help development?]

**Management** (0-10): [Score]
- Reasoning: [How does this advance business goals?]

**Market/Competitors** (0-10): [Score]
- Reasoning: [How does this position us competitively?]

**Consensus Score**: [Calculated weighted average]
```

### Phase 5: Pareto Optimization

```markdown
1. **Identify Pareto Frontier**:
   - For each opportunity, check if any other opportunity dominates it
   - Mark opportunities as pareto_optimal: true/false

2. **Portfolio Selection**:
   - Start with all Pareto optimal opportunities
   - Add high-value non-Pareto opportunities for balance
   - Ensure horizon diversity
   - Respect resource constraints

3. **Justification**:
   - Why each Pareto optimal opportunity is non-dominated
   - How the portfolio balances objectives
   - What trade-offs were considered
```

### Phase 6: Dependency Mapping

```markdown
1. **Identify Prerequisites**:
   - What MUST be done before this?
   - Hard dependencies (blocker)

2. **Find Synergies**:
   - What opportunities enhance each other?
   - Soft dependencies (amplifier)

3. **Sequence Optimization**:
   - What's the logical order?
   - Sequential dependencies (flow)

4. **Resource Conflicts**:
   - What opportunities compete for resources?
   - Resource dependencies (constraint)

5. **Create Graph**:
   - Visualize with Mermaid diagram
   - Color-code by horizon
   - Show dependency types
```

### Phase 7: Confidence Quantification

For each opportunity, rate confidence (0-100%):

```markdown
**Confidence Factors**:
- **Estimation Accuracy** (40%): How well can we estimate impact/effort?
- **Precedent** (30%): Have we done similar things?
- **Uncertainty** (20%): How many unknowns exist?
- **Volatility** (10%): How stable are assumptions?

**Example**:
OPP-QW01: 92% confidence
- High estimation accuracy (familiar territory)
- Strong precedent (similar projects)
- Low uncertainty (proven approach)
- Stable environment (low volatility)

OPP-DI01: 45% confidence
- Moderate estimation accuracy (new domain)
- Limited precedent (innovation)
- High uncertainty (many unknowns)
- Volatile environment (changing market)
```

### Critical Path Analysis:

**Path 1: Foundation → Cloud**
```
QW02 (Bugs) → QW01 (Tests) → ST01 (Microservices) → TR01 (Migration) → DI01 (AI Platform)
Duration: 28 months | Risk: Medium-High | Impact: Maximum
```

**Path 2: Documentation → Innovation**
```
ST02 (API Docs) → DI01 (AI Platform)
Duration: 26 months | Risk: Medium | Impact: High
```

### Dependency Types Legend:
- **→ (solid)**: Prerequisite (must complete before)
- **⟷ (dashed)**: Synergy (mutually reinforcing)
- **⚡**: Resource conflict (same team/budget)

### Sequencing Recommendations:

**Phase 1 (Months 0-3)**: Launch Quick Wins
- Start: QW02, QW03 in parallel
- Complete: QW01 after QW02
- **Rationale**: Build momentum, establish foundation

**Phase 2 (Months 3-12)**: Execute Strategic
- Start: ST01 (depends on QW01), ST02 in parallel
- Complete: Both by month 12
- **Rationale**: Enable transformation

**Phase 3 (Months 12-24)**: Drive Transformation
- Start: TR01 (depends on ST01), TR02 in parallel
- Complete: Both by month 24
- **Rationale**: Major capability upgrade

**Phase 4 (Months 24+)**: Launch Disruptive
- Start: DI01 (depends on TR01, ST02)
- Complete: Month 36
- **Rationale**: Market leadership

## 🎯 HANDOFF TO NEXT AGENT

**Agent #10/12: Adversarial Reviewer**

**Your Mission**: Validate this opportunity portfolio through adversarial review

**Critical Questions to Address**:
1. Are opportunity scores realistic or inflated?
2. Have we overlooked critical risks or dependencies?
3. Are timeframes achievable or overly optimistic?
4. Do stakeholder scores reflect genuine alignment?
5. Is the Pareto optimal set truly non-dominated?
6. What opportunities might fail or underdeliver?
7. Are there conflicts between opportunities?
8. What hidden dependencies exist?

**Memory Keys to Retrieve**:
- search/opportunities/portfolio (this output)
- search/gaps/multi-dimensional (gap analysis)
- search/risks/fmea (risk analysis)

**Expected Output**: Adversarial review report with validated/challenged opportunities
