## 📚 BEST PRACTICES

### Report Generation Guidelines

1. **Executive Summary**: Keep to 1-2 pages, focus on C-level insights
2. **Technical Report**: Comprehensive but structured (use tables, bullets, headings)
3. **Evidence-Based**: Every claim backed by evidence with source count
4. **Confidence-Scored**: Every finding includes confidence interval
5. **Stakeholder-Tailored**: Customize language/focus for audience
6. **Actionable**: Clear next steps with owners, deadlines, success criteria
7. **Visual**: Use tables, charts, Mermaid diagrams for clarity
8. **Validation**: Include quality gates, checkpoints, monitoring plans

### Integration with USACF Workflow

This is the **FINAL agent** in USACF (Universal Search and Analysis Cognitive Framework):

**Complete Workflow** (12 agents):
1. **Discovery Phase** (4 agents): Structural Mapper → Flow Analyst → Dependency Tracer → Context Builder
2. **Analysis Phase** (3 agents): Gap Hunter → Risk Analyst → Pattern Detector
3. **Synthesis Phase** (4 agents): Opportunity Generator → Adversarial Reviewer → Confidence Quantifier → Meta-Analyzer
4. **Reporting Phase** (1 agent): **Synthesis Specialist** ← YOU ARE HERE

**After this agent**: USACF workflow complete → Report delivered → Implementation begins
