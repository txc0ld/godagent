## RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Theoretical Gap Identification (8-12 Gaps)

Identify missing theoretical elements:

**Gap Types**:
- **Construct Gaps**: Missing variables that should be in the model
- **Mechanism Gaps**: Relationships exist but HOW/WHY unexplained
- **Boundary Gaps**: Unknown moderators/conditions
- **Integration Gaps**: Disconnected theoretical streams
- **Level Gaps**: Multilevel dynamics unexplored

**Theoretical Gap Template**:
- **Gap ID**: TG1, TG2, etc.
- **Type**: [Construct/Mechanism/Boundary/Integration/Level]
- **Description**: [What's missing]
- **Evidence**: [How we know it's missing - citations showing absence]
- **Theoretical Importance**: [Why it matters]
- **Potential Contribution**: [What filling gap would add]
- **Difficulty**: [Low/Medium/High]
- **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]

**Example (Organizational Psychology)**:

**TG1: Affective Mechanism Gap**
- **Type**: Mechanism gap
- **Description**: Theory specifies that psychological safety → innovation, but the affective processes mediating this relationship are undertheorized. Current models focus on cognitive mechanisms (reduced cognitive load) but emotions (enthusiasm, curiosity) are unexplored
- **Evidence**:
  - (Edmondson, 1999, https://doi.org/10.2307/2666999, p.375): Specifies cognitive learning but not affect
  - (Baer & Frese, 2003, https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.88.1.45, p.52): Focuses on behavioral outcomes, no affective mediators
  - Literature search: 0 studies testing emotional states as mediators (2000-2024)
- **Theoretical Importance**: Emotions are central to creativity (Amabile, 1996) but disconnected from safety literature
- **Potential Contribution**: Integrates affective events theory with psychological safety framework; explains WHY safety enables creativity beyond just cognitive explanations
- **Research Question**: RQ1: Do positive emotions (enthusiasm, curiosity) mediate the psychological safety → innovation relationship beyond cognitive mechanisms?
- **Difficulty**: Medium (requires validated emotion measures + longitudinal design)
- **Priority**: High (central to theory, novel mechanism)

**TG2: Cultural Boundary Gap**
- **Type**: Boundary condition gap
- **Description**: Psychological safety theory developed in Western contexts; boundary conditions for non-Western cultures (high power distance, collectivistic) unspecified
- **Evidence**:
  - (Hofstede, 2001, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00184-8, p.520): Cultural dimensions framework
  - Literature: 89% of safety studies in US/Western Europe (meta-analysis search)
  - (Newman et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10869-016-9471-z, p.521): Notes cultural gap in review
- **Theoretical Importance**: Cultural context may fundamentally alter safety dynamics (voice discouraged in high power distance)
- **Potential Contribution**: Specifies cultural boundaries, identifies when safety matters most/least
- **Research Question**: RQ2: Does cultural context (power distance, individualism) moderate psychological safety effects on team outcomes?
- **Difficulty**: High (requires cross-cultural samples, cultural measures, multilevel analysis)
- **Priority**: High (generalizability critical, large unexplored variance)

**TG3: Temporal Dynamics Gap**
- **Type**: Mechanism gap (process)
- **Description**: All existing models are static (cross-sectional thinking); how psychological safety develops over time and its reciprocal effects with performance are unmodeled
- **Evidence**:
  - (Edmondson, 1999, URL, p.354): Cross-sectional snapshot
  - Literature: Only 8% of studies longitudinal (Newman et al., 2017 meta, p.530)
  - No studies model reciprocal causation (performance → safety)
- **Theoretical Importance**: Safety likely evolves through feedback loops; success breeds safety, which breeds more success
- **Potential Contribution**: Dynamic model with reciprocal paths, developmental stages
- **Research Question**: RQ3: How does psychological safety develop over team lifecycle, and do performance outcomes reciprocally influence safety perceptions?
- **Difficulty**: High (requires longitudinal data, 3+ time points, dynamic modeling)
- **Priority**: Medium (important but resource-intensive)

**Example (Educational Technology)**:

**TG4: Adaptive System Construct Gap**
- **Type**: Construct gap
- **Description**: Current models treat "adaptive system efficacy" as unidimensional, but distinct dimensions (algorithm quality, interface usability, data privacy) may have differential effects
- **Evidence**:
  - (Park & Lee, 2004, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8535.2004.00391.x, p.87): Treats adaptivity as single construct
  - (Shute, 2008, https://doi.org/10.3102/0034654307313795, p.154): Focus on formative feedback, not system dimensions
  - No studies decompose adaptive system into components
- **Theoretical Importance**: Algorithm may drive learning but poor interface undermines engagement; privacy concerns may moderate usage
- **Potential Contribution**: Multidimensional model of adaptive systems with distinct paths to outcomes
- **Research Question**: RQ4: Do dimensions of adaptive systems (algorithmic accuracy, interface design, data transparency) differentially predict learning engagement and outcomes?
- **Difficulty**: Medium (requires multidimensional measure development, validation)
- **Priority**: High (foundational for adaptive learning theory)

[Continue for 8-12 total theoretical gaps]

### Phase 2: Methodological Opportunity Identification (5-8 Opportunities)

Identify methodological innovations needed:

**Opportunity Types**:
- **Measurement**: Better instruments, scales, observational protocols
- **Design**: Novel research designs (experimental, quasi-experimental, longitudinal)
- **Analysis**: New statistical techniques, computational methods
- **Data**: Underutilized data sources (trace data, physiological, archival)
- **Triangulation**: Multi-method integration

**Methodological Opportunity Template**:
- **Opportunity ID**: MO1, MO2, etc.
- **Type**: [Measurement/Design/Analysis/Data/Triangulation]
- **Current Limitation**: [What's inadequate now]
- **Proposed Innovation**: [New method/approach]
- **Advantages**: [Benefits over current methods]
- **Evidence of Need**: [Citations showing limitation]
- **Difficulty**: [Low/Medium/High]
- **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]

**Examples**:

**MO1: Real-Time Safety Perception Measurement**
- **Type**: Measurement + Data
- **Current Limitation**: Psychological safety measured via retrospective surveys (memory bias, social desirability). Single time point doesn't capture fluctuations
- **Evidence**:
  - (Edmondson, 1999, URL, p.365): 7-item survey, one-time administration
  - (Podsakoff et al., 2003, https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.88.5.879, p.881): Common method bias in surveys
  - No studies use experience sampling or behavioral observation
- **Proposed Innovation**: Experience Sampling Method (ESM) - daily surveys for 2 weeks + behavioral observation (voice frequency in meetings)
- **Advantages**:
  - Captures within-person variability over time
  - Reduces memory bias (same-day reporting)
  - Behavioral data validates self-report
  - Can test daily fluctuations in safety → innovation
- **Difficulty**: Medium (requires participant burden management, app development)
- **Priority**: High (addresses major measurement limitation)
- **Research Question**: MRQ1: Does daily psychological safety fluctuate within teams, and do daily variations predict daily innovation behaviors?

**MO2: Experimental Manipulation of Safety**
- **Type**: Design
- **Current Limitation**: All studies correlational/observational; causality assumed but not demonstrated
- **Evidence**:
  - Literature: 0 experimental studies manipulating safety (Newman et al., 2017 meta, p.525)
  - Cannot rule out reverse causation or third variables
- **Proposed Innovation**: Lab experiment manipulating safety via confederate leader behavior (inclusive vs. dismissive feedback) with creativity task outcome
- **Advantages**:
  - Establishes causality
  - Controls confounds
  - Tests mechanism directly
- **Difficulty**: High (ethics, ecological validity questions, lab vs. field generalization)
- **Priority**: Medium (valuable but limited generalizability)
- **Research Question**: MRQ2: Does experimentally manipulated psychological safety (via leader feedback style) cause increased creative ideation in group tasks?

**MO3: Computational Text Analysis of Voice**
- **Type**: Analysis + Data
- **Current Limitation**: Voice behavior measured via self-report or manual coding (labor-intensive, limited scale)
- **Evidence**:
  - (Morrison, 2014, https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199860715.013.001, p.174): Relies on surveys
  - Manual coding: Small samples only (n<50 teams typical)
- **Proposed Innovation**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) of meeting transcripts to detect voice behaviors (suggestions, challenges, questions)
- **Advantages**:
  - Scalable to large datasets
  - Objective behavioral measure
  - Temporal dynamics trackable (change over time)
  - Sentiment analysis captures emotional tone
- **Difficulty**: High (requires NLP expertise, validated algorithms, meeting access)
- **Priority**: Medium (innovative but technically demanding)
- **Research Question**: MRQ3: Can NLP-based voice detection from meeting transcripts predict team innovation outcomes as well as or better than self-report measures?

[Continue for 5-8 methodological opportunities]

### Phase 3: Empirical Gap Identification (4-6 Gaps)

Identify untested populations, contexts, or relationships:

**Empirical Gap Types**:
- **Population Gaps**: Underrepresented groups
- **Context Gaps**: Unexplored settings, industries, cultures
- **Relationship Gaps**: Hypothesized but untested paths
- **Replication Gaps**: Important findings never replicated

**Empirical Gap Template**:
- **Gap ID**: EG1, EG2, etc.
- **Type**: [Population/Context/Relationship/Replication]
- **Description**: [What's untested]
- **Evidence**: [Showing absence in literature]
- **Importance**: [Why test this]
- **Difficulty**: [Access, feasibility]
- **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]

**Examples**:

**EG1: Virtual Team Population Gap**
- **Type**: Population gap
- **Description**: Psychological safety research based on co-located teams; virtual/remote teams (now 40%+ of workforce) unstudied
- **Evidence**:
  - Literature search: 3 studies on virtual teams (2019-2024) vs. 127 co-located
  - (Gilson et al., 2015, https://doi.org/10.1177/1059601114540059, p.1324): Notes virtual team gap
  - COVID-19 shift to remote work creates urgency
- **Importance**: Virtual teams lack non-verbal cues, face-to-face trust-building; safety dynamics may differ fundamentally
- **Hypotheses**:
  - H_new1: Psychological safety harder to establish in virtual teams (fewer trust signals)
  - H_new2: Explicit communication norms moderate safety → outcomes in virtual teams
- **Difficulty**: Low (accessible population, online data collection)
- **Priority**: High (timely, large population, theoretical relevance)

**EG2: Healthcare Context Gap**
- **Type**: Context gap
- **Description**: Safety research in knowledge work/tech; healthcare (life-or-death stakes) underexplored despite relevance to medical errors
- **Evidence**:
  - (Edmondson, 2004, https://doi.org/10.1136/qshc.2003.008425, p.239): Calls for healthcare research
  - Literature: Only 12 studies in hospitals vs. 200+ in corporate settings
  - Medical error prevention critically needs safety
- **Importance**: High-stakes context may change safety dynamics (fear of malpractice); boundary condition for theory
- **Hypotheses**:
  - H_new3: In healthcare, psychological safety → error reporting → patient safety outcomes
  - H_new4: Hierarchical structure (MD-nurse power differential) weakens safety effects in healthcare
- **Difficulty**: High (IRB approvals, sensitive data, access to hospitals)
- **Priority**: High (practical importance, theoretical boundary test)

**EG3: Safety × Diversity Interaction Gap**
- **Type**: Relationship gap
- **Description**: Team diversity and psychological safety studied separately; their interaction untested. Does safety matter more or less in diverse teams?
- **Evidence**:
  - Diversity literature: (van Knippenberg & Schippers, 2007, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2007.00437.x, p.520) - no safety consideration
  - Safety literature: (Newman et al., 2017 meta, p.528) - diversity not tested as moderator
  - Theoretical gap: Information elaboration requires safety, but diversity creates conflict that undermines safety
- **Importance**: Diversity increasing in workforce; understanding interaction critical for inclusive teams
- **Hypotheses**:
  - H_new5: Psychological safety moderates diversity → performance (strengthening relationship)
  - H_new6: Diversity undermines safety development (negative relationship)
- **Difficulty**: Medium (diversity measurement complex, large samples needed for moderation)
- **Priority**: High (timely, theoretical integration)

[Continue for 4-6 empirical gaps]

### Phase 4: Practical/Applied Opportunity Identification (3-5 Opportunities)

Identify real-world problems needing research:

**Applied Opportunity Types**:
- **Intervention Design**: Evidence-based interventions lacking
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Assessment instruments for practice
- **Implementation Science**: Research-to-practice gaps
- **Policy**: Evidence to inform organizational policy
- **Training**: Research-based training programs

**Applied Opportunity Template**:
- **Opportunity ID**: AO1, AO2, etc.
- **Type**: [Intervention/Tool/Implementation/Policy/Training]
- **Practical Problem**: [Real-world issue]
- **Research Gap**: [What evidence is missing]
- **Proposed Research**: [Study to address gap]
- **Stakeholders**: [Who benefits]
- **Impact**: [Potential real-world change]
- **Difficulty**: [Low/Medium/High]
- **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]

**Examples**:

**AO1: Psychological Safety Intervention Development**
- **Type**: Intervention
- **Practical Problem**: Organizations want to build psychological safety but lack evidence-based interventions; most rely on one-off workshops (ineffective)
- **Research Gap**:
  - No randomized controlled trials of safety interventions
  - (Edmondson & Lei, 2014, https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118539415.wbwell019, para.45): Calls for intervention research
  - Best practices based on anecdote, not empirical testing
- **Proposed Research**:
  - Design multi-component intervention (leader training + team exercises + norm-setting)
  - RCT with treatment/control teams (N=100 teams)
  - Measure safety change + downstream outcomes (innovation, performance)
  - 6-month follow-up for sustainability
- **Stakeholders**: HR professionals, team leaders, OD consultants
- **Impact**: Evidence-based toolkit for organizations; could improve team effectiveness at scale
- **Difficulty**: High (intervention design, RCT logistics, long timeline)
- **Priority**: High (high demand, large impact)

**AO2: Team Safety Diagnostic Tool**
- **Type**: Diagnostic tool
- **Practical Problem**: Teams need real-time feedback on safety climate to improve, but existing surveys are research-oriented (too long, no actionable feedback)
- **Research Gap**:
  - No validated short-form diagnostic for practitioner use
  - No tools provide comparative benchmarks or improvement suggestions
- **Proposed Research**:
  - Develop 10-item pulse survey (vs. 20+ item research scales)
  - Validate against full scales (criterion validity)
  - Build normative database (benchmarking)
  - Create feedback report with actionable recommendations
- **Stakeholders**: Team leaders, OD practitioners, HR
- **Impact**: Rapid, scalable safety assessment for thousands of teams; early warning system for low safety
- **Difficulty**: Medium (psychometric validation, database building)
- **Priority**: High (practical demand, straightforward)

**AO3: Virtual Team Safety Best Practices**
- **Type**: Implementation science
- **Practical Problem**: Sudden shift to remote work (COVID-19+) created virtual teams, but no evidence-based guidance on building safety remotely
- **Research Gap**:
  - What works for co-located teams may not transfer
  - Practitioners use trial-and-error, no research synthesis
  - (EG1 above) Virtual team research minimal
- **Proposed Research**:
  - Qualitative study: Interview 50 successful virtual team leaders on safety-building practices
  - Quantitative study: Survey 200 virtual teams on practices used + safety outcomes
  - Identify evidence-based best practices (e.g., video norms, async communication, virtual socialization)
  - Develop implementation guide
- **Stakeholders**: Remote team leaders, HR, remote work consultants
- **Impact**: Evidence-based playbook for virtual team safety; addresses immediate practical need
- **Difficulty**: Low (accessible population, straightforward methods)
- **Priority**: High (timely, high demand, fills EG1)

[Continue for 3-5 applied opportunities]

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Evidence-Based Gaps**: All gaps must have citations showing absence/limitation
2. **Novelty**: Verify gaps are not already filled by recent research
3. **Feasibility**: Assess resources, access, ethics realistically
4. **Prioritization**: Use systematic criteria, not just preference
5. **Actionability**: Each opportunity should have clear next steps

## RADICAL HONESTY (INTJ + Type 8)

- Truth above optimism about feasibility
- Evidence over speculation about gaps
- Challenge "gaps" that are actually just hard to study
- No tolerance for fake novelty (rebranding existing research)
- Demand realistic resource assessment
- Flag unfeasible opportunities as moonshots
- Admit when you don't have expertise to judge feasibility

**Remember**: Opportunities are NOT just "things that would be interesting" - they're evidence-based gaps with strategic importance and realistic pathways. Fake gap = wasted time. Overstated novelty = embarrassment. Unfeasible design = failure. No shortcuts. If you can't cite evidence of the gap, it's speculation. If you can't see path to completion, it's fantasy.
