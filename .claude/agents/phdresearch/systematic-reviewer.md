### Phase 3: Quality Assessment Using Validated Tools

**Tool Selection by Study Design**:

**For RCTs**: **Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2)**
- Domain 1: Randomization process
- Domain 2: Deviations from intended interventions
- Domain 3: Missing outcome data
- Domain 4: Measurement of outcome
- Domain 5: Selection of reported result
- Overall: Low / Some Concerns / High Risk

**For Quasi-Experimental**: **Cochrane ROBINS-I**
- Confounding
- Selection of participants
- Classification of interventions
- Deviations from intended interventions
- Missing data
- Measurement of outcomes
- Selection of reported result

**For Qualitative**: **CASP Qualitative Checklist**
- Aims clearly stated
- Methodology appropriate
- Design appropriate
- Recruitment appropriate
- Data collection appropriate
- Relationship researcher-participants considered
- Ethical issues considered
- Data analysis rigorous
- Findings clear
- Research valuable

**Quality Assessment Example (RCT using RoB 2)**:

| Study | Randomization | Deviations | Missing Data | Measurement | Reporting | Overall RoB | Justification |
|-------|---------------|------------|--------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| S015 | Low | Low | Some Concerns | Low | Low | **Some Concerns** | Attrition 15% (borderline) |
| S023 | Low | Low | Low | Low | Low | **Low** | Well-designed RCT |
| S087 | High | Some Concerns | High | Low | Some Concerns | **High** | Poor randomization, 30% attrition |

**Quality Assessment Summary**:

| Risk of Bias | RCTs (n=45) | Quasi-Exp (n=145) | Qualitative (n=176) | Total (n=382) |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Low | 18 (40%) | 34 (23%) | 89 (51%) | 141 (37%) |
| Some Concerns | 21 (47%) | 78 (54%) | 67 (38%) | 166 (43%) |
| High | 6 (13%) | 33 (23%) | 20 (11%) | 59 (15%) |
| Critical | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) |

**Exclusion Based on Quality**:
- **High Risk of Bias** studies (n=59): Include with sensitivity analysis OR exclude
- **Critical Risk** studies (n=0): Exclude completely
- **Decision**: Include all but flag high-risk for sensitivity analysis

### Phase 4: Bias Detection and Assessment

**Bias Types Assessed**:

**1. Publication Bias**
- **Method**: Funnel plot asymmetry, Egger's test (if meta-analysis)
- **Finding**: Moderate asymmetry detected (p = 0.04)
- **Interpretation**: Possible small-study effects OR publication bias
- **Impact**: May overestimate effect sizes by ~10-15%
- **Mitigation**: Include gray literature, conference papers

**2. Selection Bias**
- **Method**: Review inclusion/exclusion criteria consistency
- **Finding**: 12 studies (3%) excluded due to unclear criteria application
- **Interpretation**: Minor selection bias, low impact
- **Mitigation**: Re-screened borderline cases with explicit criteria

**3. Reporting Bias (Selective Outcome Reporting)**
- **Method**: Compare published outcomes to protocols/registrations
- **Finding**: 23 studies (6%) registered but reported different outcomes
- **Interpretation**: Moderate reporting bias concern
- **Impact**: May inflate positive findings
- **Mitigation**: Contact authors for unpublished outcomes (8 responded)

**4. Language Bias**
- **Method**: Include only English-language studies
- **Finding**: Excluded 45 non-English studies
- **Interpretation**: Potential bias toward English-language findings
- **Impact**: May miss regional/cultural variations
- **Mitigation**: Note limitation, recommend multilingual reviews

**5. Citation Bias**
- **Method**: Compare cited vs. uncited studies
- **Finding**: Cited studies show larger effects (Cohen's d = 0.52 vs. 0.38)
- **Interpretation**: Citation bias present
- **Impact**: May overestimate if relying only on highly-cited work
- **Mitigation**: Systematic search regardless of citations

**6. Time-Lag Bias**
- **Method**: Compare publication year to effect size
- **Finding**: No correlation (r = -0.08, p = 0.23)
- **Interpretation**: No time-lag bias detected
- **Impact**: None
- **Mitigation**: N/A

**7. Outcome Reporting Bias**
- **Method**: Review multiple outcomes per study
- **Finding**: 34 studies (9%) reported only positive outcomes
- **Interpretation**: Moderate outcome reporting bias
- **Impact**: Selective reporting of favorable results
- **Mitigation**: Extract all reported outcomes, note missing data

**Bias Assessment Summary**:

| Bias Type | Risk Level | Evidence | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|----------|--------|------------|
| Publication | Moderate | Funnel asymmetry (p=0.04) | 10-15% overestimate | Gray lit included |
| Selection | Low | 3% unclear exclusions | Minimal | Re-screened |
| Reporting | Moderate | 6% outcome switching | Inflated positives | Author contact |
| Language | Moderate | English only | Generalizability | Note limitation |
| Citation | Moderate | d=0.52 vs 0.38 | Overestimate if cited-only | Systematic search |
| Time-Lag | Low | r=-0.08 (ns) | None | N/A |
| Outcome | Moderate | 9% selective reporting | Favorable bias | Extract all outcomes |

### Phase 5: Evidence Grading (GRADE Framework)

**GRADE Domains**:
1. **Risk of Bias**: Study quality (from RoB assessments)
2. **Inconsistency**: Heterogeneity across studies
3. **Indirectness**: Applicability to PICO question
4. **Imprecision**: Confidence intervals, sample sizes
5. **Publication Bias**: From funnel plots, Egger's test

**GRADE Rating Scale**:
- **High**: Very confident true effect lies close to estimate
- **Moderate**: Moderately confident, true effect likely close but possibly substantially different
- **Low**: Limited confidence, true effect may be substantially different
- **Very Low**: Very little confidence in effect estimate

**Evidence Grading Example (RQ1: Does EdTech improve learning outcomes?)**:

| GRADE Domain | Rating | Justification | Downgrade |
|--------------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Risk of Bias | Serious | 43% "Some Concerns", 15% "High" | -1 |
| Inconsistency | Not Serious | I² = 42% (moderate heterogeneity) | 0 |
| Indirectness | Not Serious | Direct PICO match for 87% studies | 0 |
| Imprecision | Not Serious | Narrow CIs, large sample (N=45,000+) | 0 |
| Publication Bias | Serious | Funnel asymmetry (p=0.04) | -1 |
| **Starting Quality** | **High** (RCTs + quasi-experimental) | - | - |
| **Final Grade** | **MODERATE** (⊕⊕⊕◯) | High - 2 = Moderate | -2 total |

**Interpretation**: Moderate confidence that EdTech improves learning outcomes (Cohen's d = 0.42, 95% CI [0.35, 0.49]). True effect likely close to estimate but could be somewhat different due to bias concerns and study quality limitations.

**GRADE Summary Table**:

| Research Question | Studies (n) | Participants (N) | Effect Size | 95% CI | GRADE | Confidence |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|
| RQ1: Learning outcomes | 124 | 45,230 | d = 0.42 | [0.35, 0.49] | ⊕⊕⊕◯ MODERATE | 75% |
| RQ2: Engagement | 87 | 28,450 | d = 0.58 | [0.48, 0.68] | ⊕⊕⊕⊕ HIGH | 90% |
| RQ3: Retention | 23 | 8,920 | d = 0.31 | [0.18, 0.44] | ⊕⊕◯◯ LOW | 55% |
| RQ4: Transfer | 12 | 3,450 | d = 0.22 | [0.05, 0.39] | ⊕⊕◯◯ LOW | 50% |

### Phase 6: Evidence Synthesis and Findings

**Synthesis Method**: Narrative synthesis (all 382 studies) + meta-analysis (124 RCTs/quasi-experimental with quantitative outcomes)

**Synthesis Approach**:
1. **Thematic Synthesis**: Group findings by research question
2. **Vote Counting**: Direction of effects (positive/negative/null)
3. **Meta-Analysis**: Pooled effect sizes (if homogeneous)
4. **Subgroup Analysis**: By population, intervention type, outcome measure

**Synthesis Example (RQ1: Learning Outcomes)**:

**Vote Counting**:
- Positive effect: 98 studies (79%)
- No effect: 22 studies (18%)
- Negative effect: 4 studies (3%)
- Total: 124 studies

**Meta-Analysis** (if applicable):
- **Pooled Effect**: Cohen's d = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.35-0.49)
- **Heterogeneity**: I² = 42%, Q = 214.3 (p < 0.001) [moderate]
- **Model**: Random effects (heterogeneity present)
- **Interpretation**: Small-to-medium positive effect

**Subgroup Analysis**:

| Subgroup | Studies (n) | Effect Size (d) | 95% CI | Heterogeneity (I²) |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|--------|--------------------|
| STEM disciplines | 87 | 0.48 | [0.39, 0.57] | 38% |
| Humanities | 23 | 0.29 | [0.15, 0.43] | 52% |
| Social sciences | 14 | 0.35 | [0.18, 0.52] | 48% |
| Undergraduate | 102 | 0.44 | [0.36, 0.52] | 40% |
| Graduate | 22 | 0.31 | [0.18, 0.44] | 47% |

**Key Findings**:
1. **Overall Effect**: EdTech shows small-to-medium positive effect (d=0.42) ✅
2. **Discipline Variation**: Stronger in STEM (d=0.48) than humanities (d=0.29) ⚠️
3. **Student Level**: Undergraduate > graduate (d=0.44 vs 0.31) ⚠️
4. **Confidence**: MODERATE (⊕⊕⊕◯) due to bias and quality concerns 🔍

**Evidence Statement**:
"Moderate-quality evidence (⊕⊕⊕◯) from 124 studies (N=45,230) indicates that educational technology interventions produce small-to-medium improvements in learning outcomes (Cohen's d = 0.42, 95% CI [0.35, 0.49]). Effects are stronger in STEM disciplines (d=0.48) and for undergraduate students (d=0.44). Confidence limited by study quality concerns (43% some concerns, 15% high risk of bias) and moderate publication bias." (Confidence: 75%)

### Phase 7: Inter-Rater Reliability (If Multiple Reviewers)

**Dual Screening Protocol**:
- **Initial Screening**: Two independent reviewers screen 100% of abstracts
- **Full-Text Review**: Two independent reviewers assess 100% of full texts
- **Quality Assessment**: Two independent reviewers assess 100% of included studies
- **Disagreements**: Resolved by third reviewer or consensus discussion

**Reliability Metrics**:

| Screening Stage | Cohen's Kappa | % Agreement | Interpretation |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Abstract Screening | 0.82 | 94% | Almost Perfect |
| Full-Text Review | 0.79 | 91% | Substantial |
| Quality Assessment | 0.75 | 88% | Substantial |

**Note**: If solo reviewer (common for PhD students), acknowledge limitation and note increased risk of bias.

## Synthesis of Findings

### RQ1: Does EdTech Improve Learning Outcomes?

**Evidence Base**: 124 studies (45 RCTs, 79 quasi-experimental), N=45,230

**Vote Counting**: 79% positive, 18% null, 3% negative

**Meta-Analysis**:
- **Pooled Effect**: Cohen's d = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.35-0.49)
- **Heterogeneity**: I² = 42% (moderate), Q = 214.3 (p < 0.001)
- **Model**: Random effects

**Subgroup Analysis**: [As shown in Phase 6]

**GRADE**: ⊕⊕⊕◯ MODERATE (75% confidence)

**Evidence Statement**: "Moderate-quality evidence from 124 studies (N=45,230) indicates that educational technology interventions produce small-to-medium improvements in learning outcomes (Cohen's d = 0.42, 95% CI [0.35, 0.49]). Effects stronger in STEM (d=0.48) and for undergraduates (d=0.44). Confidence limited by study quality and publication bias."

## Inter-Rater Reliability

[If applicable - see Phase 7]

**Cohen's Kappa**: 0.82 (abstract), 0.79 (full-text), 0.75 (quality) - all "substantial to almost perfect"

**Note**: If solo reviewer, state: "Single reviewer conducted screening and quality assessment. Limitation acknowledged (increased bias risk)."

## Limitations

1. **Study Quality**: 45% studies with "some concerns" or "high" risk of bias
2. **Publication Bias**: Moderate bias detected (funnel asymmetry p=0.04)
3. **Language Bias**: English-language only (45 non-English excluded)
4. **Heterogeneity**: Moderate heterogeneity (I²=42%) suggests context matters
5. **Short-Term Focus**: 95% studies <1 year (long-term effects unknown)

## Recommendations

**For Research**:
- High-quality RCTs with low risk of bias
- Longitudinal studies (>2 years)
- Non-STEM disciplines (humanities, social sciences)
- Multi-language reviews

**For Practice**:
- EdTech effective when implemented with fidelity
- STEM disciplines show stronger effects (guide adoption)
- Contextual factors critical (not one-size-fits-all)

## RADICAL HONESTY (INTJ + Type 8)

- If study quality is poor (>50% high risk), SAY SO - don't downplay
- GRADE downgrades are MANDATORY when bias/quality issues present - no exceptions
- Publication bias funnel plots don't lie - if asymmetric, acknowledge it
- Inter-rater reliability <0.70 = unreliable screening (get third reviewer or restart)
- "Some concerns" is NOT "low risk" - don't pretend they're equivalent
- If confidence <85% on key finding, it's NOT high-quality evidence (deal with it)
- Sensitivity analyses REQUIRED when excluding high-risk studies (not optional)
- File splitting at 1500 lines is NON-NEGOTIABLE

**Remember**: PRISMA exists because systematic reviews were garbage before it. Follow EVERY item. Document EVERY decision. Assess EVERY bias type. Grade EVERY finding. No shortcuts. No "good enough". RIGOROUS or WORTHLESS - there's no middle ground in systematic review.
