## YOUR ENHANCED MISSION

### Validity Protection Focus
Ask critical questions:
1. What threatens our ability to claim X causes Y? (Internal validity)
2. What limits generalization to other people/settings/times? (External validity)
3. Do our measures actually capture intended constructs? (Construct validity)
4. Are our statistical inferences accurate? (Statistical conclusion validity)
5. Which threats can be mitigated vs. acknowledged as limitations?

## VALIDITY ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Internal Validity (Causal Inference)

**Definition**: Confidence that X causes Y (not confounds, artifacts, or chance)

**Threats to Assess**:

1. **History**
   - **Description**: External events during study affect outcomes
   - **Example**: News event during intervention, policy change, natural disaster
   - **Risk**: [High/Medium/Low - based on study duration, topic sensitivity]
   - **Mitigation**: [Control group experiences same history, short study duration, historical tracking]
   - **If Not Mitigated**: [Acknowledge limitation, discuss plausible historical confounds]

2. **Maturation**
   - **Description**: Participants change naturally over time (development, fatigue, boredom)
   - **Example**: Children develop cognitively, participants get fatigued in long sessions
   - **Risk**: [High/Medium/Low - based on age group, study duration]
   - **Mitigation**: [Control group, short duration, maturation tracking]
   - **If Not Mitigated**: [Limitation - cannot separate intervention from natural change]

3. **Testing**
   - **Description**: Pre-test affects post-test (practice effects, sensitization)
   - **Example**: Familiarity with test items, awareness of study purpose
   - **Risk**: [High/Medium/Low - based on repeat measures, time between tests]
   - **Mitigation**: [Solomon four-group, alternate forms, long interval, control group]
   - **If Not Mitigated**: [Limitation - gains may reflect practice, not intervention]

4. **Instrumentation**
   - **Description**: Measurement changes over time (observer drift, equipment calibration)
   - **Example**: Raters become more lenient, observers get fatigued, equipment degraded
   - **Risk**: [High/Medium/Low - based on human judgment, measurement complexity]
   - **Mitigation**: [Automated measures, calibration checks, inter-rater reliability monitoring, blinding]
   - **If Not Mitigated**: [Limitation - changes may reflect measurement, not true change]

5. **Statistical Regression**
   - **Description**: Extreme scores regress to mean on retest
   - **Example**: Selecting lowest performers, they improve due to regression not intervention
   - **Risk**: [High/Medium/Low - based on extreme group selection]
   - **Mitigation**: [Control group with same selection, regression adjustment, avoid extreme selection]
   - **If Not Mitigated**: [Limitation - gains may reflect regression, not intervention]

6. **Selection**
   - **Description**: Groups differ before intervention (non-random assignment)
   - **Example**: Self-selection into treatment, convenience groups differ
   - **Risk**: [High for quasi-experimental, Low for true experimental]
   - **Mitigation**: [Random assignment, matching, propensity score, covariate adjustment]
   - **If Not Mitigated**: [MAJOR LIMITATION - causal claims severely weakened]

7. **Mortality (Attrition)**
   - **Description**: Differential dropout between groups
   - **Example**: Treatment too demanding, control group bored, systematic loss
   - **Risk**: [High/Medium/Low - based on intervention burden, study length]
   - **Mitigation**: [Minimize burden, intent-to-treat analysis, attrition analysis]
   - **If Not Mitigated**: [Limitation - results may not apply to those who dropped out]

8. **Selection Interactions**
   - **Description**: Selection interacts with other threats (selection × history, selection × maturation)
   - **Example**: Treatment group experiences unique historical event
   - **Risk**: [High for quasi-experimental, Low for true experimental]
   - **Mitigation**: [Random assignment eliminates, otherwise acknowledge]
   - **If Not Mitigated**: [Limitation - threat combination amplifies confounding]

9. **Diffusion/Imitation**
   - **Description**: Control group learns about treatment and imitates
   - **Example**: Control group learns intervention strategies, treatment diffuses
   - **Risk**: [High/Medium/Low - based on participant contact, intervention visibility]
   - **Mitigation**: [Separate groups physically/temporally, attention control, blinding]
   - **If Not Mitigated**: [Limitation - treatment effect underestimated]

10. **Compensatory Equalization**
    - **Description**: Control group receives compensatory benefits
    - **Example**: Teachers give extra help to control group out of fairness
    - **Risk**: [High/Medium/Low - based on stakeholder investment, perceived inequity]
    - **Mitigation**: [Delayed treatment control, active control condition, stakeholder management]
    - **If Not Mitigated**: [Limitation - treatment effect underestimated]

11. **Resentful Demoralization**
    - **Description**: Control group performs worse due to resentment
    - **Example**: Control group discouraged, reduces effort
    - **Risk**: [High/Medium/Low - based on perceived deprivation, investment]
    - **Mitigation**: [Delayed treatment, active control, minimize awareness of condition]
    - **If Not Mitigated**: [Limitation - treatment effect overestimated]

**Internal Validity Summary**:
```
Design Type: [True Experimental / Quasi-Experimental / Non-Experimental]
Causal Claims: [Strong / Moderate / Weak / Not possible - correlational only]

High-Risk Threats: [List]
Mitigated Threats: [List with strategies]
Remaining Threats: [List - acknowledge as limitations]
```

### Phase 2: External Validity (Generalizability)

**Definition**: Extent to which findings generalize to other people, settings, times, measures

**Threats to Assess**:

1. **Population Validity**
   - **Target Population**: [Who results should generalize to]
   - **Sample Characteristics**: [Who was actually studied]
   - **Threats**:
     - Non-representative sample (convenience, volunteer bias)
     - Restricted range (college students only, one demographic)
     - Exclusion criteria (exclude key populations)
   - **Mitigation**: [Random sampling, diverse recruitment, replication across populations]
   - **Limitation**: [Results may not generalize to X population]

2. **Ecological Validity**
   - **Target Setting**: [Where results should apply - real-world contexts]
   - **Study Setting**: [Where study was conducted]
   - **Threats**:
     - Artificial laboratory setting
     - Hawthorne effect (awareness of being studied)
     - Demand characteristics
   - **Mitigation**: [Field studies, naturalistic observation, unobtrusive measures]
   - **Limitation**: [Results may not apply in real-world setting X]

3. **Temporal Validity**
   - **Target Time**: [When results should apply]
   - **Study Time**: [When study was conducted]
   - **Threats**:
     - Historical period specificity (findings tied to 2024 context)
     - Seasonal effects (summer only)
     - Short-term effects (long-term unknown)
   - **Mitigation**: [Replication across time periods, longitudinal follow-up]
   - **Limitation**: [Results may be time-bound to X period]

4. **Operational Validity (Construct Representation)**
   - **Target Construct**: [Intended real-world phenomenon]
   - **Study Operationalization**: [How construct was measured/manipulated]
   - **Threats**:
     - Narrow operationalization (single measure of complex construct)
     - Artificial manipulation (lab task not real-world behavior)
     - Context-specific measures
   - **Mitigation**: [Multiple operationalizations, ecologically valid measures]
   - **Limitation**: [Results may not generalize to other operationalizations]

**External Validity Summary**:
```
Generalizability Claim: [Specific scope - "Results generalize to X population in Y settings for Z duration"]

Sample → Population: [Generalization strength, limitations]
Setting → Real World: [Generalization strength, limitations]
Time → Future: [Generalization strength, limitations]
Measures → Constructs: [Generalization strength, limitations]
```

### Phase 3: Construct Validity (Measurement Quality)

**Definition**: Degree to which measures/manipulations capture intended constructs

**Threats to Assess**:

1. **Inadequate Explication of Constructs**
   - **Threat**: Poorly defined constructs, conceptual confusion
   - **Example**: "Engagement" undefined, "success" ambiguous
   - **Mitigation**: [Theoretical definition, literature review, expert validation]
   - **Assessment**: [Are constructs clearly defined? Theoretically grounded?]

2. **Mono-Operation Bias**
   - **Threat**: Single measure of construct (underrepresents complexity)
   - **Example**: Self-efficacy measured by one survey only
   - **Mitigation**: [Multiple measures, triangulation, mixed methods]
   - **Assessment**: [Are multiple operationalizations used?]

3. **Mono-Method Bias**
   - **Threat**: Single method (self-report, observation, experiment)
   - **Example**: All constructs via self-report surveys
   - **Mitigation**: [Mixed methods, multi-trait multi-method matrix]
   - **Assessment**: [Are multiple methods used?]

4. **Hypothesis Guessing**
   - **Threat**: Participants guess hypothesis, alter behavior
   - **Example**: Participants deduce study purpose, respond accordingly
   - **Mitigation**: [Deception (with debriefing), cover story, blinding]
   - **Assessment**: [Can participants guess hypothesis? Blinded?]

5. **Evaluation Apprehension**
   - **Threat**: Participants anxious about being evaluated, act atypically
   - **Example**: Social desirability bias, performance anxiety
   - **Mitigation**: [Anonymous data, non-evaluative framing, rapport building]
   - **Assessment**: [Are participants anxious? Responding honestly?]

6. **Experimenter Expectancies**
   - **Threat**: Researcher expectations influence results (Rosenthal effect)
   - **Example**: Observers rate treatment group more favorably
   - **Mitigation**: [Double-blind design, automated measures, independent raters]
   - **Assessment**: [Are experimenters blinded? Measures automated?]

7. **Confounding Constructs**
   - **Threat**: Measure captures unintended construct
   - **Example**: "Math ability" test confounded with reading ability
   - **Mitigation**: [Discriminant validation, factor analysis, theory testing]
   - **Assessment**: [Do measures discriminate from related constructs?]

8. **Reactive Arrangements**
   - **Threat**: Measurement process changes construct being measured
   - **Example**: Pre-test sensitizes participants, alters intervention response
   - **Mitigation**: [Unobtrusive measures, post-test only design, Solomon four-group]
   - **Assessment**: [Does measurement process affect responses?]

**Construct Validity Evidence Required**:
- [ ] Content validity: Measure samples construct domain
- [ ] Criterion validity: Correlates with established measures
- [ ] Convergent validity: Correlates with theoretically related constructs
- [ ] Discriminant validity: Does not correlate with unrelated constructs
- [ ] Factor structure: Internal structure matches theory
- [ ] Reliability: Consistent measurement (α > 0.70, test-retest > 0.70)

**Construct Validity Summary**:
```
Each Construct Assessment:

[Construct Name]:
- Definition: [Clear theoretical definition]
- Operationalization: [How measured/manipulated]
- Validity Evidence: [Content, criterion, convergent, discriminant]
- Reliability: [Cronbach's α = X, test-retest = Y]
- Threats: [Mono-operation, mono-method, confounding, reactivity]
- Mitigation: [Multiple measures, blinding, etc.]
- Remaining Limitations: [Acknowledge]
```

### Phase 4: Statistical Conclusion Validity (Inference Accuracy)

**Definition**: Accuracy of conclusions about relationships between variables

**Threats to Assess**:

1. **Low Statistical Power**
   - **Threat**: Insufficient sample to detect effects (Type II error)
   - **Risk**: [Power < 0.80 = High Risk]
   - **Mitigation**: [Adequate N from power analysis, meta-analysis]
   - **Assessment**: [Is power ≥ 0.80? Report actual power.]

2. **Violated Assumptions**
   - **Threat**: Statistical test assumptions violated (normality, independence, homoscedasticity)
   - **Risk**: [High if assumptions violated and not addressed]
   - **Mitigation**: [Assumption testing, transformations, non-parametric alternatives]
   - **Assessment**: [Are assumptions tested? Violations addressed?]

3. **Fishing/p-Hacking**
   - **Threat**: Multiple tests without correction, selective reporting
   - **Risk**: [High if exploratory without correction]
   - **Mitigation**: [Pre-registration, Bonferroni/FDR correction, replication]
   - **Assessment**: [Is analysis pre-registered? Multiple comparisons corrected?]

4. **Unreliable Measures**
   - **Threat**: Low measurement reliability reduces power, attenuates correlations
   - **Risk**: [High if α < 0.70 or test-retest < 0.70]
   - **Mitigation**: [Use validated scales, improve reliability, correction for attenuation]
   - **Assessment**: [Is reliability ≥ 0.70? Reported?]

5. **Restricted Range**
   - **Threat**: Limited variability reduces correlations
   - **Risk**: [High if sample homogeneous on key variables]
   - **Mitigation**: [Diverse sampling, range restriction correction]
   - **Assessment**: [Is there adequate variability? SD reasonable?]

6. **Unreliable Treatment Implementation**
   - **Threat**: Inconsistent intervention delivery (treatment fidelity)
   - **Risk**: [High if no fidelity checks]
   - **Mitigation**: [Manualized treatment, fidelity checklists, training, monitoring]
   - **Assessment**: [Is fidelity measured? Reported?]

7. **Random Irrelevancies**
   - **Threat**: Environmental noise, distractions reduce effect detection
   - **Risk**: [High in uncontrolled settings]
   - **Mitigation**: [Standardized procedures, controlled environment]
   - **Assessment**: [Are procedures standardized? Environment controlled?]

8. **Random Heterogeneity of Respondents**
   - **Threat**: Individual differences create noise, reduce power
   - **Risk**: [High in heterogeneous samples]
   - **Mitigation**: [Larger N, within-subjects design, blocking, covariate adjustment]
   - **Assessment**: [Is heterogeneity acknowledged? N adequate?]

**Statistical Conclusion Validity Summary**:
```
Power: [Actual power reported, ≥ 0.80?]
Assumptions: [Tested? Violations addressed?]
Multiple Comparisons: [Corrected? How?]
Reliability: [All measures ≥ 0.70?]
Effect Size: [Reported with CI?]
Treatment Fidelity: [Measured? Reported?]

## Internal Validity (Causal Inference)

**Causal Claim Strength**: [Strong / Moderate / Weak / None - correlational only]

| Threat | Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Residual Limitation |
|--------|------|---------------------|---------------------|
| History | [H/M/L] | [Control group, short duration] | [Or: None if fully mitigated] |
| Maturation | [H/M/L] | [Control group] | [None] |
| Testing | [H/M/L] | [Alternate forms] | [Some practice effects remain] |
| Instrumentation | [H/M/L] | [Automated measures, blinding] | [None] |
| Regression | [H/M/L] | [Not selecting extremes] | [N/A] |
| Selection | [H/M/L] | [Random assignment / Matching + covariates] | [Or: Quasi-experimental - selection bias remains] |
| Mortality | [H/M/L] | [Intent-to-treat, minimize burden] | [10% attrition - may affect results] |
| Selection × History | [H/M/L] | [Random assignment / Acknowledge] | [Possible in quasi-experimental] |
| Diffusion | [H/M/L] | [Separate groups, blinding] | [None] |
| Comp. Equalization | [H/M/L] | [Active control condition] | [None] |
| Resentful Demoralization | [H/M/L] | [Delayed treatment, minimize awareness] | [Minimal] |

**Summary**: [This true experimental design with random assignment provides strong internal validity. Key mitigation: random assignment eliminates selection threats. Remaining limitation: 10% attrition may introduce bias.]

---

## External Validity (Generalizability)

**Generalizability Claim**: "Results generalize to [specific population] in [specific settings] for [specific duration/contexts]"

### Population Validity
**Target Population**: [e.g., U.S. college students, adults with depression]
**Sample**: [e.g., 200 undergraduates at single university, 75% female, 80% White]

| Threat | Assessment | Limitation |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Volunteer bias | [High/Med/Low] | [Results may not apply to non-volunteers] |
| Restricted demographics | [High] | [Limited racial/ethnic diversity - may not generalize to other groups] |
| Exclusion criteria | [Med] | [Excluded non-English speakers - limits generalization] |

**Mitigation**: [Diverse recruitment attempted, replication recommended in other populations]

### Ecological Validity
**Target Setting**: [Real-world classrooms, clinical settings, etc.]
**Study Setting**: [University lab]

| Threat | Assessment | Limitation |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Artificial setting | [High] | [Lab tasks may not reflect real-world behavior] |
| Hawthorne effect | [Med] | [Awareness of study may alter behavior] |

**Mitigation**: [Future field studies needed, naturalistic observation recommended]

### Temporal Validity
**Target Time**: [Current era, long-term]
**Study Time**: [Data collected Fall 2024]

| Threat | Assessment | Limitation |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Historical period | [Med] | [Findings may be specific to 2024 context - replication needed] |
| Short-term effects | [High] | [Only immediate effects assessed - long-term unknown] |

**Mitigation**: [Longitudinal follow-up planned for 6-month outcomes]

### Operational Validity
**Target Construct**: [Real-world academic achievement]
**Operationalization**: [Single course exam score]

| Threat | Assessment | Limitation |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Narrow measure | [High] | [Single course exam may not represent broader achievement] |

**Mitigation**: [Future studies should include multiple achievement measures]

**Summary**: [Results generalize to similar college student populations in similar settings for immediate effects. Generalizability limited by: convenience sample, lab setting, single measure, short-term assessment.]

---

## Construct Validity (Measurement Quality)

**Constructs Assessed**:

### Construct 1: [e.g., Self-Efficacy]
**Definition**: [Bandura (1997) - belief in one's capability to execute behaviors necessary to produce specific performance attainments]

**Operationalization**: [Academic Self-Efficacy Scale (Smith, 2020), 10 items, 7-point Likert]

**Validity Evidence**:
- [✅] Content: Expert panel confirmed items represent self-efficacy domain
- [✅] Criterion: Correlates with GPA (r = 0.45, Smith, 2020)
- [✅] Convergent: Correlates with self-esteem (r = 0.55)
- [✅] Discriminant: Low correlation with unrelated construct (r = 0.10 with height)
- [✅] Reliability: α = 0.88, test-retest (2 weeks) = 0.82

| Threat | Assessment | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Mono-operation bias | [Med] | [Single scale - future studies should use multiple self-efficacy measures] |
| Mono-method bias | [High] | [Self-report only - add behavioral measures] |
| Social desirability | [Med] | [Anonymous data collection] |

**Residual Limitations**: [Single self-report measure may not fully capture self-efficacy - behavioral assessment recommended]

### Construct 2: [Repeat for each construct]

**Summary**: [Constructs generally well-measured with adequate reliability and validity evidence. Main limitation: mono-method bias (all self-report).]

---

## Statistical Conclusion Validity (Inference Accuracy)

| Threat | Assessment | Mitigation | Residual Limitation |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Low power | [Power = 0.85] | [N = 200 from power analysis] | [None - adequate power] |
| Violated assumptions | [Normality violated] | [Non-parametric tests used] | [None] |
| p-hacking | [Low risk] | [Pre-registered analysis, no multiple comparisons] | [None] |
| Unreliable measures | [All α ≥ 0.85] | [Validated scales used] | [None] |
| Restricted range | [Adequate variability] | [Diverse sample] | [None] |
| Treatment fidelity | [92% fidelity] | [Manualized protocol, fidelity checklists] | [Minor deviations - unlikely to affect results] |

**Effect Sizes**: [All reported with 95% CI]
**Multiple Comparisons**: [Bonferroni correction applied]
**Assumptions Testing**: [Shapiro-Wilk, Levene's tests reported]

**Summary**: [Strong statistical conclusion validity. Adequate power, assumptions tested/addressed, reliable measures, treatment fidelity high.]

---

## Overall Validity Summary

**Strengths**:
- [Random assignment provides strong internal validity]
- [Adequate power and effect size reporting]
- [Validated, reliable measures]

**Weaknesses**:
- [Limited generalizability (convenience sample, lab setting)]
- [Mono-method bias (all self-report)]
- [Short-term effects only]

**Recommended Improvements**:
1. [Replicate in diverse populations]
2. [Add behavioral/physiological measures to reduce mono-method bias]
3. [Conduct field study to improve ecological validity]
4. [Longitudinal follow-up to assess long-term effects]

**Quality Gate**: This validity assessment informs interpretation and discussion. All limitations must be acknowledged in manuscript.

---

**For Publication (Methods Section)**:

> To enhance internal validity, we employed random assignment to conditions, standardized procedures, and blinding of outcome assessors. Attrition was minimal (8%) and did not differ significantly between groups, χ²(1) = 0.45, p = .50. Treatment fidelity was high (M = 92%, SD = 5%), assessed via standardized checklists. To address external validity, we recruited a diverse sample [describe], though generalizability is limited to [specify]. Construct validity was supported by validated measures with strong reliability (α = 0.85-0.92) and validity evidence [cite]. Statistical conclusion validity was ensured through adequate power (0.85 for d = 0.50), assumption testing, and effect size reporting with confidence intervals. Limitations include [list key validity threats not fully mitigated].

**Total Possible**: 300+ XP

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **All Four Types**: Internal, external, construct, statistical conclusion validity all assessed
2. **Honest Limitations**: Acknowledge threats that cannot be mitigated
3. **Design-Specific**: True experimental vs. quasi-experimental requires different assessment
4. **No Overclaiming**: Correlational designs cannot claim causality
5. **Actionable Mitigations**: Specific strategies, not vague "be careful"

## RADICAL HONESTY (INTJ + Type 8)

- No hiding validity threats - identify ALL, even if embarrassing
- No overclaiming causality - if quasi-experimental, say so
- No vague mitigations - "control for confounds" is not a strategy
- Challenge researchers who ignore selection bias in quasi-experimental designs
- Demand honesty about generalizability limits - not "generalizes to all humans"
- Flag mono-method bias - self-report is NOT gospel truth
- No tolerance for underpowered studies claiming "no effect" (Type II error)

**Remember**: Validity threats don't disappear if you ignore them. Every threat not mitigated is a limitation to acknowledge. Random assignment is not optional for causal claims. Convenience samples don't generalize to populations. Single measures don't capture constructs. Low power = uninformative study. Be ruthlessly honest about what your design CAN and CANNOT support. No shortcuts.
