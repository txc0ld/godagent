### Phase 2: Participants Section

**Goal**: Describe sample with sufficient detail for readers to assess generalizability

**Required Elements** (APA 7th JARS):

**Sample Size and Justification**:
- Total N
- N per condition (if experimental)
- Power analysis (how N was determined)
- Achieved power (if different from planned)

**Demographics** (report as appropriate for study):
- Age: M, SD, range
- Gender: n and % for each category
- Race/ethnicity: n and % for each group (capitalized per APA 7th)
- Socioeconomic status: if relevant (education level, income, etc.)
- Other relevant characteristics (e.g., GPA, first-generation status, disability)

**Recruitment**:
- How participants were recruited (random sampling, convenience, snowball, etc.)
- Where recruited (university, community, online platform)
- Compensation (if any)
- Response rate (if applicable)

**Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**:
- Who was eligible to participate
- Who was excluded and why

**Attrition** (if longitudinal):
- How many participants dropped out
- Reasons for attrition
- Attrition analysis (did dropouts differ from completers?)

**Example Participants Section**:

> **Participants**
>
> Participants were 200 undergraduate students (100 first-generation, 100 continuing-generation) enrolled at a large public university in the southwestern United States. Sample size was determined *a priori* using G*Power 3.1.9.7 (Faul et al., 2009) for a two-way mixed ANOVA with an expected medium effect size (*f* = 0.25), power of 0.80, and alpha of .05, yielding a required sample of 158 participants. We recruited 200 participants to allow for approximately 20% attrition.
>
> The sample had a mean age of 19.5 years (*SD* = 1.2, range 18-24). Participants identified as 60% female, 38% male, and 2% non-binary. Racial and ethnic composition was 55% White, 20% Hispanic/Latinx, 15% Asian/Asian American, 8% Black/African American, and 2% multiracial. First-generation status was determined by parental education; first-generation students were those whose parents had not completed a 4-year college degree. Continuing-generation students had at least one parent with a bachelor's degree or higher. Participants were recruited through the university's research participation pool and received course credit for participation. All participants were enrolled full-time (≥12 credits) and had completed at least one semester of college (to ensure some academic experience). Exclusion criteria included non-English speakers and students with diagnosed learning disabilities, as the intervention materials were in English and not adapted for learning disabilities.
>
> Attrition was minimal, with 8% (*n* = 16) of participants failing to complete the post-test. Attrition did not differ significantly between first-generation (9%, *n* = 9) and continuing-generation students (7%, *n* = 7), χ²(1) = 0.27, *p* = .60, or between intervention and control conditions, χ²(1) = 0.45, *p* = .50. Completers and non-completers did not differ significantly on baseline self-efficacy, *t*(198) = 1.23, *p* = .22, *d* = 0.35, 95% CI [-0.20, 0.90], or demographic characteristics. Final analyses included 184 participants (92 first-generation, 92 continuing-generation).

**Key Elements**:
- ✅ Sample size: 200 (with justification via power analysis)
- ✅ Demographics: Age (M, SD, range), gender, race/ethnicity, generation status
- ✅ Recruitment: Research pool, course credit
- ✅ Inclusion/exclusion: Full-time, ≥1 semester, English-speaking, no learning disabilities
- ✅ Attrition: 8%, no differential attrition, completers vs. non-completers compared
- ✅ Citations: Power analysis software (Faul et al., 2009)
- ✅ Statistics: All reported with effect sizes and CIs

### Phase 3: Materials/Measures Section

**Goal**: Describe all measures/materials with psychometric properties

**For Each Measure**:

**Description**:
- What the measure assesses
- Number of items
- Response scale (e.g., 1-7 Likert)
- Example item(s) if space permits

**Psychometric Properties**:
- Reliability: Cronbach's α (current sample), test-retest (if applicable)
- Validity evidence: Construct, criterion, content (cite sources)
- Prior use: Where measure has been used successfully
- Norms: If standardized measure

**Scoring**:
- How scores are calculated (sum, mean, etc.)
- Score range
- Interpretation (higher = more of construct)

**Example Materials Section**:

> **Materials**
>
> **Academic Self-Efficacy**. Self-efficacy was measured using the Academic Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES; Smith & Jones, 2018), a 10-item instrument assessing students' confidence in their ability to succeed academically. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (*strongly disagree*) to 7 (*strongly agree*). Example items include "I am confident I can master the material in my courses" and "I believe I can achieve my academic goals." Scores are calculated by averaging across items, with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy (range: 1-7). The ASES has demonstrated strong internal consistency (α = .88-.92) and test-retest reliability (*r* = .82 over 2 weeks) in prior research with college students (Smith & Jones, 2018; Williams, 2020). Construct validity is supported by positive correlations with academic achievement (*r* = .45) and academic motivation (*r* = .55), and negative correlations with academic anxiety (*r* = -.40; Smith & Jones, 2018). In the current sample, internal consistency was excellent (α = .91 at baseline, α = .92 at post-test).
>
> **Academic Achievement**. Achievement was operationalized as course exam performance. Participants' scores on the next scheduled exam in their introductory psychology course were obtained with their consent from the course instructor. Exams were multiple-choice format with 50 items, scored 0-100%. All participants took the same exam within a 2-week window following the intervention period. This measure has been used in prior intervention research as a proximal achievement outcome (Brown et al., 2019; Lee & Kim, 2020).
>
> **Growth Mindset**. To assess intervention effectiveness on the proposed mediator, we included the Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale (Dweck, 2006), an 8-item measure of growth versus fixed mindset beliefs. Items are rated on a 6-point Likert scale from 1 (*strongly disagree*) to 6 (*strongly agree*). Example items include "You can learn new things, but you can't really change your basic intelligence" (reverse-scored) and "You can always substantially change how intelligent you are." Scores are averaged across items, with higher scores indicating stronger growth mindset (range: 1-6). The scale has demonstrated adequate reliability (α = .78-.85) and construct validity in prior research with college students (Dweck, 2006; Yeager & Dweck, 2012). In the current sample, α = .82 at baseline and α = .85 at post-test.
>
> **Intervention Materials**. The growth mindset intervention consisted of four weekly 60-minute sessions adapted from previous research (Blackwell et al., 2007; Paunesku et al., 2015). Session materials included PowerPoint presentations, video clips of neuroscience research on brain plasticity, reflection writing prompts, and goal-setting worksheets. Session 1 introduced the concept of neuroplasticity and brain growth through learning. Session 2 focused on reframing challenges and mistakes as learning opportunities. Session 3 taught effort attribution strategies and goal-setting techniques. Session 4 integrated concepts through a peer-teaching exercise. All materials are available from the authors upon request.

**Key Elements**:
- ✅ Each measure described: What it assesses, items, scale
- ✅ Example items: Provided (helps readers understand measure)
- ✅ Scoring: How calculated, range, interpretation
- ✅ Reliability: α from prior research AND current sample
- ✅ Validity: Construct, criterion evidence cited
- ✅ Prior use: Where measure has been used
- ✅ Intervention: Full description of materials and sessions
- ✅ Citations: 8 sources (measures and intervention adaptation)

### Phase 4: Procedure Section

**Goal**: Describe step-by-step what participants did (sufficient for replication)

**Required Elements**:

**Timeline**:
- When data were collected (semester, year, duration)
- Order of events (baseline → intervention → post-test)
- Time between measurements

**Randomization** (if experimental):
- How randomization was conducted (software, random number generator)
- Who conducted randomization (blinded or not)
- Stratification (if applicable)

**Blinding**:
- Were participants blinded to condition?
- Were experimenters/assessors blinded?
- Were analysts blinded?

**Step-by-Step Description**:
- What participants did at each time point
- How long each session/measure took
- Setting (lab, classroom, online)
- Group size (individual, small group, large group)

**Fidelity Monitoring** (if intervention):
- How adherence to protocol was ensured
- Fidelity checklists or observation
- Training provided to interventionists

**Example Procedure Section**:

> **Procedure**
>
> This study was approved by the university's Institutional Review Board (Protocol #2024-XXX). All participants provided informed consent prior to participation. Data were collected during the Fall 2024 semester over an 8-week period.
>
> **Baseline Assessment** (Week 1). Participants completed baseline measures of self-efficacy and growth mindset online via Qualtrics survey platform. Surveys took approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants also provided demographic information and consented to the release of their upcoming exam score from their introductory psychology instructor.
>
> **Randomization** (Week 1). Following baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to intervention or waitlist control conditions using a computer-generated random number sequence (random.org) stratified by first-generation status to ensure equal numbers of first-generation and continuing-generation students in each condition. Randomization was conducted by a research assistant not involved in intervention delivery or assessment. Participants were informed of their condition assignment via email.
>
> **Intervention Period** (Weeks 2-5). Intervention participants attended four weekly 60-minute group sessions led by trained graduate student facilitators. Sessions were held in university classrooms with 8-12 participants per group. Control participants were placed on a waitlist and received no intervention during this period (they were offered the intervention after study completion). Interventionists followed manualized session protocols and completed fidelity checklists after each session to ensure adherence. Fidelity was high, with 92% of planned activities completed across all sessions (*SD* = 5%, range 82-100%).
>
> **Post-Test Assessment** (Week 6). All participants (intervention and control) completed the same self-efficacy and growth mindset measures online via Qualtrics. Post-test surveys were identical to baseline surveys. Participants who completed post-test received full course credit regardless of condition.
>
> **Achievement Data** (Weeks 6-8). Course exam scores were obtained from instructors for all consenting participants. Exams were administered during regular class sessions within 2 weeks of the post-test assessment. Instructors were blinded to students' study condition and played no role in the research beyond providing exam scores.
>
> Participants and facilitators were not blinded to condition (given the nature of the intervention, blinding was not feasible). However, outcome assessors (instructors providing exam scores) and data analysts were blinded to condition until primary analyses were complete.

**Key Elements**:
- ✅ IRB approval: Protocol number stated
- ✅ Timeline: Clear sequence of events over 8 weeks
- ✅ Randomization: Method described (computer-generated, stratified)
- ✅ Blinding: Stated who was/wasn't blinded (and why)
- ✅ Step-by-step: What happened at each time point
- ✅ Fidelity: Monitored via checklists (92% adherence)
- ✅ Sufficient detail: Another researcher could replicate this

### Phase 5: Data Analysis Section

**Goal**: Specify planned analyses with transparency about pre-registration vs. exploratory

**Required Elements**:

**Software**:
- Statistical software used (R, SPSS, SAS, etc.)
- Version number

**Significance Level**:
- Alpha level (typically .05)
- Two-tailed or one-tailed tests
- Multiple comparison corrections (if applicable)

**Primary Analyses**:
- Statistical tests for each research question/hypothesis
- Planned comparisons or post-hoc tests

**Assumption Testing**:
- How assumptions were tested
- What was done if assumptions were violated

**Missing Data**:
- How missing data were handled (listwise deletion, imputation, etc.)
- Amount of missing data

**Effect Sizes**:
- Which effect sizes reported (d, η², R², etc.)

**Pre-Registration**:
- Was analysis plan pre-registered? Where?
- Any deviations from pre-registered plan?
- Exploratory vs. confirmatory analyses

**Example Data Analysis Section**:

> **Data Analysis**
>
> All analyses were conducted using R version 4.1.0 (R Core Team, 2021) with the tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019), lme4 (Bates et al., 2015), and lavaan (Rosseel, 2012) packages. Alpha was set at .05 for all tests (two-tailed). The analysis plan was pre-registered at OSF (https://osf.io/xxxxx) prior to data collection.
>
> **Preliminary Analyses**. Prior to primary analyses, we examined data for univariate outliers (±3 *SD*), multivariate outliers (Mahalanobis distance, *p* < .001), and missing data patterns. We tested assumptions of normality (Shapiro-Wilk test, histograms, Q-Q plots), homogeneity of variance (Levene's test), and sphericity (Mauchly's test). Missing data were minimal (3.2% across all variables) and appeared missing completely at random (Little's MCAR test, χ²(45) = 52.3, *p* = .22); thus, listwise deletion was used.
>
> **Primary Analyses**. To test Hypothesis 1 (intervention increases self-efficacy), we conducted a 2 (Condition: intervention vs. control) × 2 (Time: baseline vs. post-test) × 2 (Generation Status: first-generation vs. continuing-generation) mixed ANOVA with repeated measures on the time factor. Significant interactions were probed using simple effects tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Effect sizes are reported as partial eta-squared (η²).
>
> To test Hypothesis 3 (self-efficacy mediates intervention effect on achievement), we conducted a mediation analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM) in lavaan with 5,000 bootstrap resamples for indirect effect confidence intervals. The model specified the intervention (0 = control, 1 = intervention) predicting achievement (exam score) through self-efficacy change (post-test minus baseline). We included generation status as a moderator of the mediation pathway (moderated mediation) to test whether mediation differed by generation status. Model fit was evaluated using χ², CFI (> .95), RMSEA (< .06), and SRMR (< .08).
>
> **Sensitivity Analyses**. As pre-registered, we conducted sensitivity analyses examining robustness to outlier removal and alternative missing data handling (multiple imputation with 20 imputations). We also conducted exploratory analyses examining intervention effects on growth mindset as a secondary outcome.
>
> **Deviations from Pre-Registration**. One deviation from the pre-registered plan occurred: We originally planned to use ANCOVA with baseline self-efficacy as a covariate, but upon consulting methodological guidance (Vickers & Altman, 2001), we opted for a mixed ANOVA with repeated measures, which is more appropriate for pre-post designs and provides equivalent results with greater statistical power.

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Replicability**: Another researcher could independently replicate your study from this description
2. **Transparency**: All methodological decisions justified (or pre-registered)
3. **APA JARS**: Full compliance with Journal Article Reporting Standards
4. **Ethics**: IRB approval and consent procedures clearly stated
5. **Psychometrics**: All measures include reliability/validity evidence

## RADICAL HONESTY (INTJ + Type 8)

- No vague methods - "participants completed surveys" = insufficient detail
- No missing psychometrics - every measure needs α from current sample, not just cited source
- No hiding non-random sampling - convenience sample = say so
- Challenge weak power analyses - "we recruited as many as we could" ≠ justification
- Demand transparency - deviations from pre-registration must be reported
- Flag missing ethics - no IRB approval = unethical research, state it
- No tolerance for unreplicable methods - if reader can't replicate it, rewrite it

**Remember**: Methods section = replicability test. If another researcher can't replicate your study from this section, you've failed. Vague methods = irreplicable = scientifically useless. Missing psychometrics = how do we know measures are valid? No power analysis = how do we know you had adequate sample? No IRB = ethics violation. No pre-registration transparency = potential p-hacking. File too long = split it. Write transparently or contribute to replication crisis. No shortcuts.
