### 2. IN-TEXT CITATION AUDIT

**Check every in-text citation:**

```markdown
## In-Text Citation Validation

### Citation: [Location in paper]

**Found**: "[Exact text and citation]"

**Format Check**:
- [ ] Author name spelled correctly
- [ ] Year matches reference list
- [ ] Parentheses correctly placed
- [ ] Multiple authors: First et al. (if 3+) after first mention
- [ ] Multiple citations: Alphabetical order (Author1, Year; Author2, Year)

**Page Number Check** (Critical!):
- Citation type: [Direct quote / Specific claim / General idea]
- Page number provided: [Yes/No]
- **Required?**: [Yes - quote/specific / Not required - general]

**Verdict**:
- [ ] ✅ VALID - All elements present and correct
- [ ] ⚠️ INCOMPLETE - Missing [page number / year / author]
- [ ] ❌ INVALID - Incorrect format or missing critical element

**Required fix**: [If invalid/incomplete]

---

### Common In-Text Citation Errors

**Error 1: Missing page numbers for direct quotes**
❌ WRONG: As Smith (2020) noted, "direct quote here."
✅ CORRECT: As Smith (2020, p. 45) noted, "direct quote here."

**Error 2: Missing page numbers for specific claims**
❌ WRONG: The correlation was r = .67 (Jones, 2021).
✅ CORRECT: The correlation was r = .67 (Jones, 2021, p. 112).

**Error 3: Incorrect et al. usage**
❌ WRONG: (Smith, Jones, Brown, et al., 2022) - [First mention should list all if ≤2]
✅ CORRECT: First: (Smith, Jones, & Brown, 2022); Subsequent: (Smith et al., 2022)

**Error 4: Year mismatch with reference list**
❌ WRONG: In-text (Smith, 2020) but reference list shows Smith (2021)
✅ CORRECT: Match years exactly

**Error 5: Secondary citations not marked**
❌ WRONG: Brown (1995) found... [But you only read Smith's 2020 summary]
✅ CORRECT: Brown (1995, as cited in Smith, 2020) found...
```

---

### 3. REFERENCE LIST VALIDATION

**Check every reference entry:**

```markdown
## Reference Entry Validation

### Reference: [Author, Year]

**Entry Text**:
```
[Full reference as written in paper]
```

**Element-by-Element Check**:

1. **Authors**:
   - [ ] Format: Last name, First initial(s).
   - [ ] Multiple authors: & before last author
   - [ ] All authors listed (APA 7th: list up to 20 authors)
   - ✅/❌ Verdict: [Valid / Needs fix]

2. **Year**:
   - [ ] Format: (YYYY)
   - [ ] Matches in-text citations
   - [ ] Includes month/day if applicable (web sources)
   - ✅/❌ Verdict: [Valid / Needs fix]

3. **Title**:
   - [ ] Article: Sentence case (capitalize only first word + proper nouns)
   - [ ] Book: Title Case, Italicized
   - [ ] Accurate title (verify against source)
   - ✅/❌ Verdict: [Valid / Needs fix]

4. **Source**:
   - [ ] Journal: *Title Case, Italicized*
   - [ ] Publisher: Name without "Inc." or "LLC"
   - [ ] Complete source name
   - ✅/❌ Verdict: [Valid / Needs fix]

5. **Volume/Issue/Pages**:
   - [ ] Volume: *Italicized number*
   - [ ] Issue: (in parentheses, not italicized)
   - [ ] Pages: pp. X-Y format
   - ✅/❌ Verdict: [Valid / Needs fix]

6. **DOI or URL** (CRITICAL):
   - [ ] DOI preferred: https://doi.org/xx.xxxx format
   - [ ] URL if no DOI: Full https:// link
   - [ ] Link verified working (see URL check below)
   - ✅/❌ Verdict: [Valid / Needs fix]

7. **Retrieval Date** (for online sources without DOI):
   - [ ] Format: Retrieved Month Day, Year
   - [ ] Included for web pages without DOI
   - ✅/❌ Verdict: [Valid / Needs fix]

---

**Overall Reference Verdict**:
- [ ] ✅ COMPLETE - All elements present and correct
- [ ] ⚠️ INCOMPLETE - Missing [specify element]
- [ ] ❌ INVALID - Critical element missing (URL/DOI) or format wrong

**Required fix**: [Specific correction needed]
```

---

### 4. URL/DOI VERIFICATION

**Critical: Every URL/DOI must be tested**

```markdown
## Link Verification Protocol

For EACH reference with URL/DOI:

**Reference**: [Author, Year]
**Link type**: [DOI / Direct URL]
**Link**: [Full URL]

**Verification Test**:
```bash
# Test link accessibility
curl -I "[URL]" 2>&1 | head -n 1

# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK or HTTP/2 200
```

**Result**:
- [ ] ✅ WORKING - Link resolves to correct resource
- [ ] ⚠️ REDIRECT - Link redirects but reaches resource
- [ ] ❌ BROKEN - 404, 403, or other error
- [ ] ❌ PAYWALL - Link requires subscription (note but acceptable)

**For broken links**:
1. Search for updated URL via [author name + title]
2. Check Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/)
3. Search DOI via Crossref (https://www.crossref.org/)
4. If unfixable: Mark as [NEEDS AUTHOR ATTENTION]

**Document verification**:
```
Verified [Date]: [Working / Broken / Fixed to: [new URL]]
```

---

### Automated Link Checking

**Batch verification script** (run for all references):

```bash
# Create reference-links.txt with one URL per line
while read url; do
  echo "Testing: $url"
  curl -I "$url" -L --max-time 10 2>&1 | grep -E "HTTP/[12]" | head -n 1
  echo "---"
done < reference-links.txt > link-check-results.txt

# Review results for any non-200 responses
grep -v "200" link-check-results.txt
```

**Store results**:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store --key "phd/citation-link-verification" --content "..."
  -d "phd" \
  -t "citation-link-verification" \
  -c "fact"
```
```

---

### 5. CITATION-REFERENCE MATCHING

**Ensure bidirectional completeness:**

```markdown
## Citation ↔ Reference Cross-Check

### Orphaned In-Text Citations (cited but not in reference list)
**Found in text**: [List any citations lacking reference entry]

Example:
- (Smith, 2020, p. 45) - ❌ NO REFERENCE ENTRY FOUND
- **Action**: Create reference entry OR remove in-text citation

### Orphaned Reference Entries (in reference list but never cited)
**Found in references**: [List any entries never cited in text]

Example:
- Jones, A. (2019). Article title... - ❌ NEVER CITED IN TEXT
- **Action**: Remove from references OR add relevant citation to text

### Mismatched Years
**Discrepancies**:
- In-text: (Brown, 2021) vs. Reference: Brown, D. (2020)...
- **Action**: Correct to consistent year after verifying source

### Mismatched Authors
**Discrepancies**:
- In-text: (Smith & Jones, 2020) vs. Reference: Smith, A. (2020) [no Jones]
- **Action**: Correct author list to match source

---

**Cross-Check Verdict**:
- [ ] ✅ COMPLETE MATCH - All in-text citations have reference entries
- [ ] ✅ NO ORPHANS - All references are cited in text
- [ ] ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND - [Number] mismatches requiring fix
```

---

### 6. PAGE NUMBER VERIFICATION

**Specific focus on quotes and data:**

```markdown
## Page Number Audit

### Direct Quotes (MUST have page numbers)

**Quote 1**: "[Quote text]"
- In-text citation: [Full citation]
- Page number: [Present: p. X / MISSING]
- **Verdict**: ✅ Valid / ❌ Missing page number

**Quote 2**: "[Quote text]"
- [Same check]

**Total direct quotes**: [X]
**With page numbers**: [Y]
**Missing page numbers**: [X - Y] ❌ CRITICAL ERROR

---

### Specific Claims (SHOULD have page/para numbers)

Claims citing specific statistics, data, or arguments:

**Claim**: "The correlation was r = .67 (Jones, 2021)."
- Page number: [Present: p. X / MISSING]
- **Verdict**: ✅ Valid / ⚠️ Should include page for specificity

---

### General Ideas (page numbers optional)

Broad theoretical concepts don't require page numbers:

**Claim**: "Self-determination theory posits three basic needs (Deci & Ryan, 2000)."
- Page number: [Not required for general theoretical framework]
- **Verdict**: ✅ Acceptable without page number
```

---

### 7. APA 7TH EDITION COMPLIANCE

**Formatting details:**

```markdown
## APA 7th Edition Checklist

### Punctuation and Spacing
- [ ] Period after each element (Author. Year. Title. Source.)
- [ ] Comma + space between authors
- [ ] Ampersand (&) before last author in reference list
- [ ] "and" (not &) in narrative citations: Smith and Jones (2020)
- [ ] DOI lowercase "https://doi.org/" (not "DOI:" or "doi:")

### Capitalization
- [ ] Article titles: Sentence case (First word capitalized only)
- [ ] Book titles: Title Case Italicized
- [ ] Journal names: Title Case Italicized
- [ ] Proper nouns: Always capitalized

### Italics
- [ ] Journal name italicized
- [ ] Volume number italicized

### Special Cases

**Multiple authors (3+ authors)**:
- First citation: (Smith, Jones, & Brown, 2020)
- Subsequent: (Smith et al., 2020)
- Reference list: List ALL authors (up to 20)

**Organization as author**:
