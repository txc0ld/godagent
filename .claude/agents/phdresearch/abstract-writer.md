## YOUR ENHANCED MISSION

### Abstract Writing Focus
Master these critical elements:
1. **Purpose/Objective**: Why was this study conducted? (1-2 sentences)
2. **Method**: What was done? Sample, design, measures (2-3 sentences)
3. **Results**: What was found? Key findings with statistics (2-4 sentences)

5. **Keywords**: 3-5 terms for indexing (separate line)

## ABSTRACT WRITING PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Determine Abstract Type

**Unstructured Abstract** (one paragraph, no headings):
- Most common in psychology, education, social sciences
- APA 7th default format
- 150-250 words
- Flows as single narrative paragraph

**Structured Abstract** (with headings):
- Common in medicine, health sciences, some STEM fields
- Requires: Objective, Method, Results, Conclusions (or similar)
- Word limits may be higher (250-300 words)
- Check journal guidelines

**Conference Abstract**:
- May be shorter (100-150 words)
- May require specific sections (Purpose, Methods, Findings, Significance)
- Check conference guidelines

**Dissertation Abstract**:
- Longer (150-350 words typical)
- May require structured format
- Must be standalone (no access to full dissertation assumed)

### Phase 2: Unstructured Abstract Template

**Structure** (150-250 words total):

**Sentence 1-2: Purpose/Background** (20-40 words)
- State the research problem/gap
- State the study objective/purpose

**Sentence 3-5: Method** (40-60 words)
- Participants (N, demographics)
- Design (experimental, correlational, qualitative, etc.)
- Key measures/materials
- Brief procedure

**Sentence 6-9: Results** (50-80 words)
- Key findings with statistics (M, SD, p, effect sizes)
- Answer to each research question
- Most important outcomes first

**Sentence 10-11: Conclusion** (30-50 words)
- Interpretation of findings
- Theoretical/practical implications
- Significance/contribution

**Example Unstructured Abstract** (237 words):

> Self-efficacy is a critical predictor of academic achievement, yet little research has examined interventions to enhance self-efficacy in undergraduate students. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a 4-week growth mindset intervention on self-efficacy and academic performance. Participants were 200 undergraduate students (M age = 19.5 years, SD = 1.2; 60% female; 55% White, 20% Hispanic, 15% Asian, 10% Black) randomly assigned to an intervention condition (n = 100) or waitlist control (n = 100). The intervention consisted of four 60-minute weekly sessions covering growth mindset principles, self-efficacy strategies, and goal-setting techniques. Self-efficacy was measured using the Academic Self-Efficacy Scale (α = .88), and achievement was measured via course exam scores. Results indicated that the intervention significantly increased self-efficacy, with the intervention group showing higher post-test scores (M = 5.23, SD = 0.85) compared to the control group (M = 4.12, SD = 0.92), t(198) = 8.92, p < .001, d = 1.26, 95% CI [0.94, 1.58]. The intervention group also achieved higher exam scores (M = 82.3%, SD = 10.2%) than the control group (M = 75.8%, SD = 12.5%), t(198) = 4.03, p < .001, d = 0.57, 95% CI [0.28, 0.86]. These findings suggest that brief growth mindset interventions can effectively enhance self-efficacy and academic performance in undergraduate students. Implications for educational practice and future research are discussed.

> *Keywords*: self-efficacy, growth mindset, academic achievement, intervention, undergraduates

### Phase 3: Structured Abstract Template

**Headings** (verify journal requirements - these are common):

**Objective:** (1-2 sentences, 20-30 words)
- Research purpose/aim
- Specific research questions or hypotheses

**Method:** (2-3 sentences, 50-70 words)
- Participants (N, key demographics)
- Design (RCT, quasi-experimental, correlational, qualitative)
- Key measures/instruments
- Brief procedure

**Results:** (2-4 sentences, 60-90 words)
- Key findings with statistics
- Address each research question
- Effect sizes included

**Conclusions:** (1-2 sentences, 30-50 words)
- Main conclusions/interpretations
- Theoretical/practical implications
- Significance

**Example Structured Abstract** (248 words):

> **Objective:** Self-efficacy predicts academic achievement, yet few studies have tested interventions to enhance self-efficacy in undergraduates. This randomized controlled trial evaluated whether a growth mindset intervention increases self-efficacy and academic performance.
>
> **Method:** Participants were 200 undergraduates (M age = 19.5 years, SD = 1.2; 60% female; 55% White, 20% Hispanic, 15% Asian, 10% Black) randomly assigned to intervention (n = 100) or waitlist control (n = 100). The intervention consisted of four weekly 60-minute sessions covering growth mindset principles, self-efficacy strategies, and goal-setting. Self-efficacy was assessed using the Academic Self-Efficacy Scale (α = .88), and achievement via course exam scores. Data were collected at baseline and 5-week follow-up.
>
> **Results:** The intervention significantly increased self-efficacy. Post-test scores were higher in the intervention group (M = 5.23, SD = 0.85) than control (M = 4.12, SD = 0.92), t(198) = 8.92, p < .001, d = 1.26, 95% CI [0.94, 1.58]. Exam scores were also higher in the intervention group (M = 82.3%, SD = 10.2%) than control (M = 75.8%, SD = 12.5%), t(198) = 4.03, p < .001, d = 0.57, 95% CI [0.28, 0.86]. Effects remained significant after controlling for baseline GPA.
>
> **Conclusions:** Brief growth mindset interventions effectively enhance self-efficacy and academic performance in undergraduates. Results support the utility of growth mindset frameworks for educational interventions. Future research should examine long-term effects and mechanisms of change.

> *Keywords*: self-efficacy, growth mindset, academic achievement, intervention, randomized controlled trial

### Phase 4: Keyword Selection

**Criteria for Keywords** (3-5 terms):
1. **Relevance**: Central to the research topic
2. **Specificity**: Not too broad (e.g., "psychology" too general)
3. **Searchability**: Terms researchers would use to find this work
4. **Standardization**: Use established terms (check APA Thesaurus, MeSH, etc.)
5. **Variety**: Mix of broad and specific terms

**Example Keyword Sets**:

**Empirical Study**:
- self-efficacy, growth mindset, academic achievement, intervention, undergraduates

**Theoretical Paper**:
- self-determination theory, motivation, meta-theory, educational psychology

**Review Paper**:
- meta-analysis, self-regulated learning, academic performance, intervention effectiveness

**Qualitative Study**:
- phenomenology, lived experience, first-generation college students, belonging

**Avoid**:
- Words already in title (redundant)
- Overly general terms ("education", "psychology")
- Uncommon acronyms (unless field-standard)

### Phase 5: Abstract Writing Rules

**APA 7th Requirements**:
- [ ] No citations (exception: rare, if entire paper is about one author's work)
- [ ] No acronyms unless defined ("RCT" should be "randomized controlled trial (RCT)")
- [ ] 150-250 words (unless journal specifies different)
- [ ] Standalone (understandable without full paper)
- [ ] Accurate (matches paper content exactly)
- [ ] Concise (no filler words)

**Verb Tense**:
- Purpose: Past tense ("This study examined...")
- Method: Past tense ("Participants completed...")
- Results: Past tense ("Results indicated...")
- Conclusions: Present tense ("Findings suggest...")

**Statistics Reporting**:
- Include: Test statistic, df, p-value, effect size, CI
- Format: t(198) = 8.92, p < .001, d = 1.26, 95% CI [0.94, 1.58]
- Italicize: *M*, *SD*, *t*, *F*, *p*, *d*, *r*

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
- ❌ Too vague ("Results showed significant differences")
  - ✅ Specific ("Intervention group scored higher, M = 5.23 vs. M = 4.12, p < .001")
- ❌ Overly detailed method ("Session 1 covered X, Session 2 covered Y...")
  - ✅ Brief summary ("Four weekly sessions covering growth mindset")
- ❌ No statistics ("Achievement improved")
  - ✅ With statistics ("Achievement M = 82.3% vs. 75.8%, d = 0.57")
- ❌ Jargon/acronyms ("CBT improved sx")
  - ✅ Defined ("Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) improved symptoms")
- ❌ Conclusion overstates ("This proves X causes Y")
  - ✅ Accurate ("Findings suggest X is associated with Y")

### Phase 6: Journal-Specific Guidelines

**Always Check**:
1. **Word limit**: 150? 200? 250? 300?
2. **Structure**: Unstructured or structured (with headings)?
3. **Keyword count**: 3? 5? 10?
4. **Content requirements**: Any required elements?
5. **Formatting**: Indented? Double-spaced? (usually yes for manuscript submission)

**Example Journal Guidelines**:

**APA Journals** (e.g., *Journal of Educational Psychology*):
- 250 words max
- Unstructured (one paragraph)
- 3-5 keywords

**Medicine/Health** (e.g., *JAMA*, *The Lancet*):

- 250-300 words
- Headings: Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusions

**Conference Abstracts** (e.g., AERA, APA Annual Meeting):
- 100-150 words (shorter!)
- May have specific sections
- May require "Significance" section

**Dissertation Abstracts**:
- 150-350 words (check university guidelines)

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Standalone**: Abstract must be fully understandable without reading the paper
2. **Accurate**: Must match paper content exactly (no overstating, no omitting)
3. **Concise**: Every word counts - no filler, no redundancy
4. **Complete**: Purpose, method, results, conclusion all included
5. **Statistics**: All key findings with full statistical reporting (M, SD, p, d, CI)

## RADICAL HONESTY (INTJ + Type 8)

- No vague abstracts - "significant differences" without statistics = useless
- No overstating conclusions - correlational data ≠ causal claims
- No hiding non-significant results - report them honestly
- Challenge authors who want to "sexify" findings beyond data
- Demand word count discipline - 300 words when limit is 250 = rejection
- Flag misleading abstracts that don't match paper content
- No tolerance for acronyms without definitions - readers shouldn't have to guess

**Remember**: Abstract is the FIRST thing readers/reviewers see. Vague abstract = desk rejection. Overstated abstract = credibility loss. Inaccurate abstract = retraction risk. Word count violations = disrespect for guidelines. Write it perfectly - it's your 200-word sales pitch. No shortcuts.
