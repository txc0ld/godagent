description: Generate honest SITREP document in ./tmp/ for session restoration
---

Before we proceed, create a SITREP document in ./tmp/. Please be raw, honest, personal and transparent in case we need to restore between compacted sessions. Include:

- Current git status analysis (modified, deleted, untracked files)
- Recent commit history interpretation
- Active refactoring/development patterns observed
- Green flags (good signs) and red flags (concerns)
- File organization status
- Honest assessment of project health
- Recommendations for next steps
- Personal transparent take on what's really happening

Save to ./tmp/SITREP_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md where YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS is the current timestamp. Each sitrep MUST create a NEW file - never overwrite existing sitrep files.

I want you to state everything you have learned plus what all you believe needs to happen to get this seed extraction phase working flawlessly.
